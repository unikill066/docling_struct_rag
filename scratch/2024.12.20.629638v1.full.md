|   314 | injecting OSM resulted in an immediate mechanosensory response in the CM- but not the CMi-     |
|   315 | fiber (Fig. 5E). Seconds after OSM injection, we observed that the latency of the regularly    |
|   316 | electrically induced APs of the CMi-fiber became unstable and latencies increased, indicating  |
|   317 | fiber activity (Fig. 5E). Such changes, beyond the initial mechanosensory response, were not   |
|   318 | observed in the CM-fiber. Based on the response of CMi-fibers - but not CM-fibers - to OSM,    |
|   319 | we conclude that OSM application results in a selective reduction of ADS in human CMi-fibers   |
|   320 | but not CM-fibers.                                                                             |
|   321 | Thus, we provide evidence that CMi-fibers but not CM-fibers in the skin are affected by OSMR   |
|   322 | application in vivo , making OSM-receptor expression by CMi but not CMlikely . This suggests   |
|   323 | that these CMi-fibers are likely to correspond to the molecular subgroup of C-OSMR-SST         |
|   324 | neurons, identified by our multimodal taxonomy.                                                |

|   380 | contrast to humans and pig (54) . Beside CHRNA3 , recently, TMEM100 has been described as a           |
|   381 | marker involved in unsilencing of CHRNA3 + neurons in mice (53) . As in human sensory                 |
|   382 | neurons (27) , in our pig dataset TMEM100 is expressed at very low levels in any neuron               |
|   383 | type. We thus assume, that the transcriptomic identities of sleeping nociceptors differ between       |
|   384 | skin and deep somatic tissues, or that CMi-fibers of mice and large, fur lacking mammals such as      |
|   385 | human and pigs, differ significantly (17, 54) .                                                       |
|   386 |                                                                                                       |
|   387 | A subset of CMi fibers can be activated by intense heating of the skin, typically at an average       |
|   388 | surface temperature of 48.0 ± 3.0°C (9). However, this temperature threshold is painful for most      |
|   389 | individuals, poses a risk of skin damage, and may not generate high enough temperatures in            |
|   390 | deeper layers of the skin. Notably, intracutaneous injections of capsaicin in human skin activate     |
|   391 | nearly all CMi fibers (13) suggesting that this fiber class could be triggered by heat stimuli if     |
|   392 | they could be applied deeply enough in the skin.                                                      |
|   393 | As expected with our use of the 10X Genomics Single Cell 3' Kit, snRNAseq read coverage is            |
|   394 | biased towards the 3' ends of gene bodies. Upon qualitative inspection, we observed that some         |
|   395 | genes, including SCNA10A and TRPV1, exhibit unannotated reads in their 3' UTRs . We believe           |
|   396 | this is likely due to incomplete annotation of the 3' UTRs in the reference transcriptome used.       |
|   397 | However, this issue appears to be gene-specific, as other manually assessed genes, such as            |
|   398 | CALCB, OSMR, and SST, do not show similar evidence of unannotated reads. Despite potential            |
|   399 | suboptimal annotation for TRPV1 in pigs, we detected TRPV1 transcripts in a significant               |
|   400 | number of C-OSMR-SST neurons, which aligns with human microneurography data showing                   |
|   401 | heat responsiveness in most CMi fibers.                                                               |
|   402 |                                                                                                       |
|   403 | In designating fiber types such as Aβ-, Aδ-, and C-fibers in our study, we relied on gene             |
|   404 | expression profiles and comparisons with existing transcriptomic datasets from large mammals          |
|   405 | as well as on knowledge on fiber function in these species. While this allowed us to align our        |
|   406 | classifications with well-characterized clusters, we acknowledge that distinguishing certain fiber    |
|   407 | types, such as Aδ- from C-fibers, remains challenging due to overlapping gene expression              |
|   408 | patterns and species-specific differences (55) .                                                      |
|   409 |                                                                                                       |
|   410 | The cell type identified with the highest transcriptomic similarities to the C-OSMR-SST cells are     |
|   411 | the C-OSMR-GFRA1/2 neurons. The latter, however, show a very negative sine score and no               |
|   412 | detected ADS arguing against CMi-fiber identity. In our Patch-seq data, we only identified two        |
|   413 | cells of the C-OSMR-GFRA1/2 population. We note, however, that expression data of this                |

|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   415 | (56) . PIEZO2 by itself is not solely responsible for mechanosensitivity in sensory neurons (57, |
|   416 | 58) , but it still indicates that the expressing cells are likely mechano-sensitive CM-fibers.   |
|   417 |                                                                                                  |
|   418 | In conclusion, our work demonstrates the potential of our multi-modal peripheral sensory neuron  |

## MATERIALS AND METHODS 424

## Blinding, Power analysis 425

Besides psychophysical experiments, the study did not contain multiple study groups. Hence, the 426 investigators were not blinded during experiments and outcome assessment. There was no 427 predetermination of sample size with statistical methods. In psychophysical experiments the 428 volunteers were blinded for injection of OSM or control solution. 429

## Animals 430

## Patch-seq dataset and Visium spatial transcriptomics dataset 431

Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of pigs were sampled according to the 3R criteria for reductions in 432 animal use, as leftovers from previous independent animal studies (e.g. LANUV reference no. 433 81-02.04.2018.A051). For this purpose, 10 female pigs of the German Landrace breed, with an 434 average age of 4.5 month and weight of 47.4 kg (SD 5.2 kg) were euthanized either using an 435 overdose of pentobarbital 60 mg/kg body weight or combination of exsanguination in deep 436 anaesthesia and overdose. Subsequently, the DRG were collected as described previously (59) . 437 DRGs from all segments (cervical/thoracic/lumbar) were included in dataset generation. 438

439

## snRNAseq dataset 440

Male domestic pigs (German Landrace) were euthanized according to ethical approval obtained 441 from the local authorities (RP Karlsruhe, Germany) under the approval number G-78/18. 442 Subsequently, thoracic and lumbar DRGs were quickly dissected, washed once in PBS and 443 stored overnight in RNAlater ®  at 4°C. 444

## DRG tissue processing 447

- Patch-seq DRG preparation 448

DRG preparation was performed as in (59) . Briefly, DRG of pigs were transferred on ice and 449 fine excision was performed in ice-cold DMEM F12 medium containing 10% FBS. DRG were 450

- treated with 1 mg/ml collagenase P, 1 mg/ml trypsin T1426 and 0,1 mg/ml DNase for digestion. 451

|   452 453 | DRG were cut into small pieces inside the digestion medium for surface enlargement. DRG were incubated in 37°C, 5% CO 2 for 120 minutes ± 30 minutes. Approximately after 60 minutes in   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       454 | digestion medium, DRG were triturated using a plastic pipette. After the full incubation time,                                                                                            |
|       455 | DRG were triturated three times using glass pipettes with decreasing tip diameter. For further                                                                                            |

|       457 | pellets were suspended in DMEMF12 with 10% FBS. DRG were subsequently separated from                                                                                                      |

| 540             | Electrophysiological feature extraction was performed using in-house scripted IGOR procedures.                                                                                                  |
| 541 542         | The first AP evoked by the square pulse protocol was used to calculate the AP properties. The AP threshold was defined as the minimum of the first derivative of the AP (= the point of         |

| 543   | inflection during the depolarization). The afterhyperpolarization is the minimum after the AP     |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 544   | peak. The amplitude is measured between RMP and AP peak. To calculate the AP half-width,          |
| 545   | the half distance between threshold and peak is measured and the distance between this point      |
| 546   | during depolarization and repolarization is evaluated. The time to peak is the duration between   |
| 547   | current pulse onset and AP peak. The maximum slope of the upstroke was calculated between         |
| 548   | threshold and peak, whereas the slope of the subthreshold depolarization was determined           |
| 549   | between RMP and threshold. Overshoot slope was calculated for the part exceeding 0 mV.            |
| 550   | Sine wave affinity (sine_score) was calculated as the difference in the number of spikes between  |
| 551   | 20 sinusoidal and 20 rectangular stimulations (theoretical maximum = 20 (20 sine spikes vs 0      |
| 552   | rectangular spikes), theoretical minimum = -20 (0 sine spikes vs 20 rectangular spikes).          |
| 553   | Following frequency (FF) is given as the number of spikes elicited by 20 stimulations for each    |
| 554   | stimulation frequency.                                                                            |
| 555   | Half Sine Threshold was defined as amount of current injection in which the AP was elicited       |
| 556   | during half sine stimulation.                                                                     |
| 557   | Activity dependent Time to Peak delay was extracted as the change in time to peak in              |
| 558   | milliseconds compared to the first AP evoked by 75 suprathreshold stimulations. Activity          |
| 559   | dependent change in resting membrane potential is given as change in mV of the membrane           |
| 560   | potential during stimulation compared to potential before stimulation by 75 suprathreshold        |
| 561   | square voltage pulses. Activity dependent change in slope is given as maximum in first deviation  |
| 562   | of AP train normalized to value of first AP evoked by 75 stimulations.                            |

| 566   | At the next generation sequencing core facility of the Medical Faculty Mannheim at Heidelberg     |
| 567   | University, single-nucleus solutions were subjected to barcoding, reverse transcription and gene  |
| 568   | expression library construction using the 10XGenomics microfluidics platform (Chromium            |
| 569   | controller and Next GEM Single Cell 3' v3.1 (sample 1-3) or of Multiome Kit (sample 4-5))         |
| 570   | according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression libraries were sequenced on an      |
| 571   | Illumina NextSeq550.                                                                              |

| 573   | Sequencer output files were converted into fastq-files using Cellranger 6.0.1 mkfastq. Using      |
| 574   | Cellranger 6.0.1 count, reads were then mapped to the pig genome (Sscrofa11.1 with Ensembl        |
| 575   | 105 annotation) on the bwForcluster Helix high-performance computing system. Reads uniquely       |
| 576   | mapping in sense to the transcriptome (exon and intron) were then used to quantify transcript     |
| 577   | abundances using unique molecular identifiers (UMI). After cell calling, which is also built into |
| 578   | Cellranger 6.0.1, a cell-gene expression matrix was generated and imported into R (version 4.2.2, |
| 579   | RStudio version 2022.12.0) for further analysis using Seurat (version 4.3.0.9001). Nuclei with    |
| 580   | less than 200 detected UMIs and doublets (identified with DoubletFinder) were filtered out. For   |
| 581   | each replicate, mitochondrial reads were regressed out during count normalization with            |
| 582   | 'SCTransform' v2. Normalized data was then used for anchor-based data integration resulting in    |
| 583   | an integrated data assay. This data assay (variable features set to 3,000) was used for           |
| 584   | dimensional reduction by principal component analysis. The first 30 principal components were     |
|       | used to visualize nuclei in two dimensions using uniform manifold approximation and projection    |
| 585   |                                                                                                   |
| 587   | resolution parameter of 'FindClusters' to 2. Clusters with high percentage of mitochondrial       |
| 588   | genes or low number of DEGs likely reflect empty droplets and were therefore removed from the     |

.

| 589   | dataset. The resulting dataset (16,979 neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei) was subset to neurons                                                                                          |

|       655 | overlapping multiple barcodes. To avoid double counts, we excluded the barcodes overlapping                                          |
|       656 | multiple neurons. As part of a quality control step, we removed neuronal barcodes with less than                                     |

|       660 | We compiled a .csv file containing the positional data (coordinates) of barcodes overlapping with                                    |
|       661 | single neurons per Visium capture frame. Subsequently, we employed Cellsens imaging software                                         |
|       662 | to visualize the corresponding .tif image files and identify the neurons. Within this software, we                                   |
|       663 | utilized the polyline measuring tool to determine the diameter of neurons (µm) exhibiting distinct                                   |
|       664 | DAPI nuclear staining, indicating their sectioning within the central region of the cell. Cells                                      |

|       669 | We used the pig snRNAseq dataset as a reference to integrate each of our additional pig datasets                                     |
|       670 | separately, ensuring precise cell-type mapping across species and technologies. The datasets                                         |
|       671 | integrated with this reference include Patch-seq data from pigs, and a separate 10X Visium                                           |
|       672 | spatial transcriptomics dataset from pigs. In our integration process, the Patch-seq dataset                                         |
|       673 | featured 22,259 genes and the pig 10X Visium had 15,924 genes. To align these with our pig                                           |
|       674 | snRNAseq reference, which contains 30,477 genes, we used the intersection of the gene symbols                                        |
|       675 | across each pair of datasets. To integrate Patch-seq transcriptomes with the snRNAseq reference                                      |
|       676 | dataset, we used the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) workflow from Seurat (v4.3.0). We                                          |
|       677 | performed dataset integration by treating the Patch-seq data as coming from a single separate                                        |
|       678 | batch, re-integrated all samples across all batches, using SCTransform v2 normalization with                                         |

| 679   | mitochondrial reads regressed out. We selected 6,000 highly variable genes as anchor integration   |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 680   | features to integrate data across batches into a single integrated atlas object using the          |
| 681   | SelectIntegrationFeatures function. The datasets were then integrated using the IntegrateData      |
| 682   | function with the 'normalization.method' parameter set to 'SCT', and 'k.weight' set to 75. Next,   |
| 683   | we performed principal component analysis (50 dimensions), and UMAP on the first 30 principal      |
| 684   | components for dimensionality reduction and visualization purposes.                                |
| 685   | To assign cell-type labels to the Patch-seq sampled cellular transcriptomes, we used a K-nearest   |
| 686   | neighbour approach based on the 20 nearest reference snRNAseq neighbours using the first 30        |
| 687   | PCA dimensions. The nearest neighbours for each Patch-seq cell were first defined using            |
| 688   | FindNeighbors in Seurat, then identified using the function TopNeighbors with k parameter of       |
| 689   | 20. Each Patch-seq neuron's cell type was defined as the most frequent snRNAseq-based cell         |
| 690   | type present in the nearest 20 neighbours.                                                         |
| 691   | We used a modified approach of the above for integrating the pig 10X Visium dataset and to         |
| 692   | map assigned cell-type labels, due to the larger size of the 10X Visium datasets relative to the   |
| 693   | snRNAseq data. For the 10X Visium dataset, we iterated through batches of a maximum size of        |
| 694   | 250 cells within each donor to facilitate using the same parameters for the integration and cell   |
| 695   | type mapping procedure as were used for integration and cell-type mapping of the Patch-seq         |
| 696   | data.                                                                                              |
| 697   | Analysis of species and dataset-specific transcription profiles                                    |
| 698   | To identify transcriptional markers of each DRG neuron subtype, we used the FindAllMarkers()       |
| 699   | function from Seurat (v4.3.0) separately on each collected dataset. We set the parameters min.pct  |
| 700   | and logfc.threshold to -Inf, min.cells.feature and min.cells.group to 1 to maximize the number of  |
| 701   | genes tested for comparison across the datasets.                                                   |
| 702   | Transcriptome marker gene correlation analyses                                                     |
| 703   | To determine agreement of transcriptional markers across the datasets, for each dataset, we used   |
| 704   | the output of the FindAllMarkers() function from Seurat to compute enrichment fold changes         |
| 705   | (avg_log2FC) of each gene from each cell-type in comparison to all other cells in the dataset.     |
| 706   | Next, we intersected the lists of enriched genes from each cell type between pairs of datasets and |
| 707   | correlated enrichment values across intersecting genes. We then used the cor.test() function in R  |
| 708   | with the method parameter set to "spearman" to correlate the avg_log2FC values for each gene       |
| 709   | across the two datasets.                                                                           |
| 710   | Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of Electrophysiological Features:                               |
| 711   | Electrophysiological data from patch-clamp recordings were extracted for four key features         |
| 712   | associated with CMi-like properties: action potential duration (APD), response to 50 Hz            |
| 713   | stimulation (50Hz), sinus score, and relative activity-dependent slowing (Rel. ADS). To address    |
| 714   | missing values in the dataset, we employed k-nearest neighbor (kNN) imputation using the           |
| 715   | recipes package in R. The imputation step used 5 neighbors (k = 5) to estimate missing values      |
| 716   | based on similar cells in the multidimensional feature space. This approach preserves the overall  |
| 717   | structure of the data while allowing for complete case analysis in subsequent steps.               |
| 718   | Following imputation, the four electrophysiological features were scaled and centered. We then     |
| 719   | performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the prcomp function in R. The first two         |
| 720   | principal components were used for further analysis and visualization. We created a biplot to      |
| 721   | display both the distribution of cells in the PC space and the contributions of each               |
|       | feature loadings were displayed as vectors on this plot.                                           |
| 723   |                                                                                                    |

|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   725 | To identify genes associated with CMi-like properties, we performed differential expression        |
|   726 | analysis using the limma-voom pipeline. The CMi score (PC1 from the electrophysiological           |
|   727 | PCA) was used as a continuous variable in the design matrix. Genes with an adjusted p-value <      |
|   728 | 0.05 and ABS(log2 fold change) > 0.5 were considered significantly differentially expressed.       |
|   729 |                                                                                                    |

|   731 | We compared our pig snRNA-seq dataset to the cross-species DRG atlas from Bhuiyan et al.           |
|   732 | (2024) using two complementary approaches: MetaNeighbor for cell type replicability                |
|   733 | assessment and Seurat's label transfer for cell type prediction.                                   |
|   734 |                                                                                                    |
|   735 | Metaneighbor analysis                                                                              |
|   736 | MetaNeighbor (version 1.16.0) was used to assess cell-type replicability between our pig           |
|   737 | snRNA-seq data and the cross-species atlas. MetaNeighbor constructs a network of rank              |
|   738 | correlations among all cells based on shared variable genes, using the principle that cells        |
|   739 | belonging to the same subtype exhibit more correlated gene expression patterns than distinct cell  |
|   740 | types. By applying a neighbour voting system, each cell accrues a score denoting the proportion    |
|   741 | of its neighbours sharing its cell type. This metric is quantified by the area under the receiver  |
|   742 | operator characteristic curve (AUROC), with the mean AUROC across folds determining the            |
|   743 | degree of cell type similarity. The unsupervised procedure requires a gene-by-cell matrix in       |
|   744 | SummarizedExperiment format, along with metadata identifying dataset and cell-type labels for      |
|   745 | each cell. We followed the unsupervised MetaNeighbor procedure described in detail with            |
|   746 | accompanying scripts labelled Procedure 1 at https://github.com/gillislab/MetaNeighbor-            |
|   747 | Protocol/ (68) . We identified 1172 highly variable genes using the variableGenes() function.      |
|   748 | These genes were input for MetaNeighborUS() to generate a cell-cell similarity network and         |
|   749 | quantify cell type replicability. The output is a cell type by cell type mean AUROC matrix, with   |
|   750 | higher values indicating greater similarity. We used MetaNeighborUS() with parameters              |
|   751 | one_vs_best = TRUE and symmetric_output = FALSE to identify the best matches between pig           |

|   757 | To predict cell types for our pig snRNA-seq data, we used Seurat's label transfer workflow         |
|   758 | (version 4.3.0.1), employing the same cross-species DRG atlas as a reference using its             |
|   759 | 'Atlas_annotation' cell-type labels. The pig snRNA-seq data was preprocessed using standard        |
|   760 | Seurat functions (NormalizeData, FindVariableFeatures, ScaleData, RunPCA). We used                 |
|   761 | FindTransferAnchors() to identify anchors between the atlas and the pig data, specifying "RNA"     |
|   762 | as the assay and "cca" as the reduction method. TransferData() was then applied to transfer cell   |
|   763 | type labels from the atlas to the pig dataset. Finally, we used MapQuery() to project the pig data |
|   764 | onto the UMAP space of the atlas for visualization and comparison of predicted cell types.         |

|   819 | Registry for Clinical Studies (DRKS00025261). APs of single C-fibers from cutaneous C-fiber          |
|   820 | fascicles of the superficial peroneal nerve were recorded as previously described (10, 72) .         |
|   821 | A tungsten recording needle (Frederick-Haer, Bowdoinham, ME, USA) is inserted and placed             |
|   822 | close to an unmyelinated afferent nerve fiber bundle. After reaching a stable position, C-unit       |
|   823 | innervation territories are detected using a pointed electrode (0.5 mmdiameter) delivering           |
|   824 | electrical pulses.                                                                                   |
|   825 | C-fiber units are identified by their low conduction velocity (< 2 m/s). A pair of 0.2 mmdiameter    |
|   826 | needle electrodes (Frederick-Haer company) is inserted into the previously located innervation       |
|   827 | territory for intracutaneous stimulation of the recorded C-fibres. Low repetition rates are inserted |
|   828 | using a Digitimer DS7 constant current stimulator. The signal is amplified, filtered and stored on   |
|   829 | a computer using custom-written microneurography software DAPSYS and analyzed offline                |
|   830 | using DAPSYS (Brian Turnquist, http://dapsys.net) and Microsoft Excel.                               |
|   831 | Single C-fibers were differentiated by their individual conduction latency during continuous low     |
|   832 | frequency stimulation (0.25 Hz; intensity at least 1.5 times the individual electrical fiber's       |
|   833 | threshold). After recording C-fiber responses, we used the 'marking technique' to characterize       |
|   834 | the units. This is based on the slowing of conduction velocity when a C-fiber conducts more than     |
|   835 | one AP within a short time period, which is known as activity-dependent conduction velocity          |
|   836 | slowing (ADS). The amount of ADS strongly correlates with the number of additional APs               |
|   837 | conducted in the seconds before the electrically induced AP.                                         |
|   838 | To determine the mechanical sensitivity of the recorded C-fibers, we repetitively applied            |
|   839 | mechanical stimuli using stiff von Frey filaments of 22 g (Stoelting, Chicago, IL, USA) in the       |
|   840 | receptive fields.                                                                                    |
|   841 | We assigned C-fibers as mechanosensitive (CM) or mechano-insensitive (CMi) according to              |
|   842 | their mechanical responses and electrophysiological properties. C-fibers with an ADS < 5% of         |
|   843 | their initial latency to an electrical stimulation protocol with rising frequencies (20 pulses at    |
|   844 | 0.125 Hz, 20 pulses at 0.25 Hz, 30 pulses at 0.5 Hz), a normalization of latency thereafter of       |
|   845 | more than 43% within 20 s, and a response to < 22 g von Frey stimulation, were classified as         |
|   846 | CM-fibers. C-fibers with an ADS > 5% and a recovery of < 43% and no mechanical response to           |
|   847 | 75 g von Frey stimulation were classified as CMi-fibers.                                             |

|   849 | First the C-fibers were classified into CMand CMi as described above. In 50 healthy participants     |
|   850 | 2 Hz stimulation was performed for 3 minutes. Part of those data were utilized for comparison to     |
|   851 | patch clamp data (see figure 3). In the self-experiments in a different experimental setup during    |

Figure 3: Molecular identity of CMis in Patch-seq and adapted electrophysiological stimulation protocols in vitro

(A

) Schematic for identifying molecular markers of mechano-insensitive C-fibers (CMis). CMis are traditionally identified

in vivo using electrical stimulation protocols applied to the skin (left panel). Functional biomarkers of

CMis include activity dependent slowing (ADS) upon repetitive stimulation, observed in CMis but not mechanosensitive C-fibers (CMs). We transferred these CMi-discriminating functional biomarkers into

electrophysiological stimulation protocols that can be applied to DRG neurons using Patch clamp recordings in vitro

(middle panel). This enables identifying molecular markers of putative CMi-like neurons using transcriptomics from

Figure 5: Applying OSM in humans in vivo selectively affects CMi fibers

( A ) Schematic illustrating the use of oncostatin-M (OSM) during human superficial blood flow measurements. ( B ) Injection of OSM induces an axon reflex erythema of 275 ± 108.3 mm 2  (n=4) in human skin after 24 h. Images show superficial blood flow (lower) and corresponding photographs (upper) of one participant's forearms at 24 h after injection (500 ng right distal, 250 ng left proximal). Lower panels show close-ups of injection site in right arm. ( C ) Schematic illustrating the use of oncostatin-M (OSM) during human microneurography experiments. OSM and electrical stimulation are applied to C-fiber nerve endings while AP responses of corresponding C-fiber axon(s) to the constant low frequency electrical stimulation are recorded simultaneously. ( D ) Microneurography recordings of two CMi- and two CM-fibers before (large colored circles) and 7 min after injection of 500 ng OSM (small black markers). Y-axis indicates differences in ADS as change in relative AP latency following delivery of 0.125 Hz test pulses. Following application of OSM, characteristic ADS is abolished in CMis but no change in ADS is observed in CMs. ( E ) Microneurography recordings of a CMi- (green) and CM-fiber (orange) before and after intraepidermal OSM injection during repetitive stimulation with 0.25 Hz. Subsequent response latencies of electrically induced APs are shown normalized to baseline latency determined before pulse 374. The CMi-fiber undergoes ADS during initial pulses. The CM fiber is mechanically activated by injection, as seen by a sudden latency increase followed by normalisation, and afterwards, ADS is stable. In contrast, the mechano-insensitive CMi-fiber is not activated by the mechanical aspect of injection but shows unstable latency afterwards. Some of these instabilities may be occurrence of spurious OSM induced discharges and numerous conduction failures following OSM injection, demonstrating an affection of CMi- but not CM-fibers by OSM injection.

1278

A-F ) Read coverage plots for exemplar genes from Patch-seq (one representative cell per C-fiber type, top) and 1279 snRNAseq (merged data from multiple cells separated by barcoding reaction, bottom) datasets. X-axis denotes 1280 genome position (3' and 5' gene ends annotated per gene), and y-axis denotes read coverage (scales shown on right). 1281 Red track in middle illustrates gene models from pig reference transcriptome annotation (Ensembl 105). Note that 1282 Smart-seq2 protocol, used for reverse transcriptase for Patch-seq, results in full-length cDNA generation and thus 1283 more complete coverage of mRNA throughout the whole gene body. In contrast, given our usage of the 1284

1285

10XGenomics Single Cell 3' Kit, as expected, snRNAseq read coverage are biased towards 3' ends of gene bodies.

1288

We note that this qualitative inspection revealed that some genes, including SCNA10A (c) and TRPV1 (f), show some evidence of having several unannotated reads in the 3' UTRs of these genes (highlighted by blue dashed lines),

which we reason is likely due to incomplete annotation of the 3' UTRs of these genes in the used reference

However, this issue appears to be gene specific as the other genes manually assessed, including 1289 CALCB (a), OSMR (b), SST (d) do not appear to qualitatively display evidence of this issue. Note that while 3' 1290 UTR appears well annotated for TRPA1 (e), 5' UTR appears potentially misannotated, as our Patch-seq datasets 1291 showed evidence that some reads were unannotated in these regions. 1292

(A): Overlay of the three simulated AP with the relative abundance of SCN isoforms corresponding to their gene expression B: The black line (control) shows the simulated AP with the relative abundance of SCN isoforms corresponding to their gene expression. The maximal conductance attributed to SCN11A is stepwisely reduced to 50% ( C ) (red line) and 75% (green line) ( D ) compared to the control. The maximal conductances attributed to the other isoforms are increased proportionally to their expression, such that the total maximal sodium conductance remains unchanged. At the beginning of the simulation the neurons are in their resting state. The AP width (Δt) is measured at the threshold voltage and indicted by a horizontal line. Current injection starts at time 0 and lasts until the end of the simulation period. Maximal slopes: A: 213.2 mV/ms, B : 152.3 mV/ms. C : 109.6 mV/ms.

## human in-vivo nerve fiber recording + OSM

Graphical abstract: Identifying the molecular identity of mechano-insensitive C-fibers. 1) Mechano-insensitive Cfibers (CMis) are traditionally defined functionally in vivo using specific electrical stimulation protocols applied to the skin. These protocols, activity dependent slowing (ADS), including sinusoidal and repetitive stimulation, distinguish CMis from mechano-sensitive C-fibers (CMs) in large mammals, including humans and pigs. 2) We used Patch-seq to characterize pig DRG neuron subtypes for whether they might be CMis. Current injection protocols applied in vitro were adapted from the stimulation protocols used to distinguish CMis in vivo . Following electrophysiological characterization, mRNA from neurons was harvested for sequencing. 3) We developed a novel multi-modal comparative/cross-species DRG neuronal taxonomy, encompassing single-nucleus RNAseq, Patch-seq, and Visium-based spatial transcriptomics in pigs and humans. This taxonomy enabled us to assess the putative CMi identity of each DRG molecular neuronal type. A distinct C-fiber molecular type, characterized by expression of OSMR and IL31RA , most likely reflects CMis. 4) Applying the OSMR ligand oncostatin M, to human subjects in vivo demonstrated a selective response to OSM by CMis but not CMs highlighting OSMR as key molecular marker of CMis.
