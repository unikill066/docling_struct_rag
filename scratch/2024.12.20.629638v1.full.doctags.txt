<otsl><loc_35><loc_54><loc_442><loc_380><ched>61<ched>INTRODUCTION<nl><fcel>62<fcel>Neuropathic pain, which affects 10% of the population and 20-30% of diabetic patients, correlates with increased activity of sensory neurons in the skin called by the fairly misleading<nl><fcel>63<ecel><nl><fcel>64<fcel>name 'sleeping' or 'silent' nociceptors (1-5) . They are defined in human microneurography and<nl><fcel>65<fcel>psychophysics studies of the skin as mechano-insensitive C-fibers (CMi-fibers (6) , also termed<nl><fcel>66<fcel>type 1b fibers (7) ), and show pronounced chemical responsiveness, e.g. to capsaicin, ATP, partly<nl><fcel>67<fcel>to histamine, and several inflammatory mediators (8-11) . Under inflammatory and other painful<nl><fcel>68<fcel>conditions, CMi-fibers can be sensitized to mechanical stimuli, becoming similar to polymodal<nl><fcel>69<fcel>nociceptors (CM-fibers or type 1a-fibers (12) ).<nl><fcel>70<ecel><nl><fcel>71<fcel>Human skin contains CMis that can be reliably identified by their distinct functional and<nl><fcel>72<fcel>biophysical properties (13-16) . In contrast, rodents lack these homologous neurons in their skin;<nl><fcel>73<fcel>instead, similar neurons primarily innervate internal organs (17) . The few mechano-insensitive C-fibers identified in rodent skin display significantly different biophysical properties compared<nl><fcel>74<ecel><nl><fcel>75<fcel>to human CMis (18, 19) . While rodent models crucially advance our understanding, they limit<nl><fcel>76<fcel>our ability to deduce molecular markers or new drug targets relevant for human skin sleeping nociceptors (20) . In contrast, pig skin is innervated by neurons resembling human CMis showing<nl><fcel>77<fcel>tight correlations among mechanical, chemical and biophysical properties (21, 22) . This<nl><fcel>78<ecel><nl><fcel>79<fcel>similarity provides a valuable translational model for studying dermal nociceptive fibers relevant<nl><fcel>80<fcel>for human neuropathic pain. In mice, mechano-sensitivity appears less tightly correlated to and<nl><fcel>81<fcel>biophysical properties than in human and pigs, and the functional roles of chemosensing<nl><fcel>82<fcel>disease-related hyperactivity may be assumed by other nociceptor classes (23) .<nl><fcel>83<ecel><nl><fcel>84 85<fcel>CMi-fibers are insensitive to strong mechanical stimulation unless sensitized and are unable to follow high-frequency electrical pulses, even when sensitized (16) . These fibers preferentially respond to slow depolarization, such as low frequency sinusoidal pulses rather than square pulses (13) . A characteristic feature of these fibers is their enhanced activity-dependent slowing (ADS)<nl><fcel>86 87<ecel><nl><ecel><fcel>upon repetitive stimulation: when stimulated electrically with 2 Hz pulses in the receptive field<nl><fcel>88<fcel>for an extended time, the conduction velocity of action potentials (APs) traveling along the<nl><fcel>89<fcel>nerve<nl><fcel>90<fcel>fiber is reduced (22) . The distinct electrophysiological characteristics of CMis likely stem from<nl><fcel>91<fcel>their unique molecular architecture (24) , potentially offering an opportunity to identify specific, of<nl><fcel>92<fcel>conserved markers for human CMis. In this study, we characterize the molecular architecture these nociceptors in pigs and humans identifying oncostatin-M receptor (OSMR) and<nl><fcel>93 94<ecel><nl><ecel><fcel>somatostatin (SST) as marker genes for CMis.<nl><fcel>95<ecel><nl></otsl>

<otsl><loc_32><loc_49><loc_442><loc_446><fcel>97<fcel>RESULTS<nl><fcel>98<fcel>An integrated multi-modal taxonomy for pig peripheral sensory neurons<nl><fcel>99<fcel>Single cell transcriptomic studies of peripheral sensory neurons have revealed a molecular<nl><fcel>100<fcel>taxonomy of highly specialized and diverse cells responsible for various aspects of sensory<nl><fcel>101<fcel>perception like pain (25-30) . In contrast, functional single cell in vitro patch-clamp studies have<nl><fcel>102<fcel>not yielded a similarly comprehensive cellular taxonomy based on sensory neuron excitability,<nl><fcel>103<fcel>especially of large mammals given their described difference in electrophysiology compared to<nl><fcel>104<fcel>rodents (31) . Recent Patch-seq techniques, however, provide a unique opportunity for bridging<nl><fcel>105<fcel>the molecular identities of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons with their electrophysiological<nl><fcel>106<fcel>and morphological identity (32-37) : individual neurons are electrically characterized via patch-<nl><fcel>107<fcel>followed by single cell RNA<nl><fcel>108<fcel>clamp, sequencing.<nl><fcel>109 110<fcel>We used Patch-seq to characterize electrophysiological and transcriptomic characteristics of pig DRG neurons, intentionally targeting smaller, likely C-fiber neurons. We assessed up to 27<nl><fcel>111<fcel>electrophysiological features per cell and visualized cellular morphologies prior to capturing<nl><fcel>112<fcel>whole-cell mRNA (Fig. S1). We successfully sampled 288 neurons using our improved<nl><fcel>113<fcel>harvesting protocol (Fig. S2, methods) and analyzed their transcriptome by Smart-seq2 and deep<nl><fcel>114<fcel>sequencing. Of these, 226 neurons passed rigorous quality control of transcriptomes, with a<nl><fcel>115<fcel>median of 700,000 reads and 11,000 unique detected genes per cell (Fig. S3), demonstrating the<nl><fcel>116<fcel>deep transcriptomic characterization provided by this methodology.<nl><fcel>117<ecel><nl><fcel>118 119<fcel>We next applied droplet-based snRNAseq using the 10XGenomics Chromium v3 platform to sample transcriptomes from 16,997 nuclei from flash-frozen pig DRGs. Following rigorous<nl><fcel>120<fcel>transcriptomic filtering, we obtained 2,176 DRG neuronal nuclei, with a median of 4,574<nl><fcel>121<fcel>detected Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) and 2,131 genes expressed per nucleus. Following<nl><fcel>122<fcel>unsupervised clustering of snRNAseq-based transcriptomes we identified 16 DRG neuronal<nl><fcel>123<fcel>subtypes based on distinct marker gene expression (Fig. 1A, see methods). Important pain-<nl><fcel>124<fcel>related genes, such as CALCB , or the receptor for oncostatin M( OSMR) were reliably quantified,<nl><fcel>125<fcel>while a few, including SCN10A and TRPV1 , suffered from some degree of genome annotation<nl><fcel>126<fcel>incompleteness in the pig, as described previously (Fig. S4, (38) ). Despite this, TRPV1<nl><fcel>127<fcel>expression was detected in expected neuronal subtypes (Fig. S5), ensuring that these genome<nl><fcel>128<ecel><nl><fcel>129<fcel>annotation limitations did not impede our ability to identify its presence where anticipated.<nl><fcel>130 131<fcel>We mapped each Patch-seq characterized cell to our larger snRNAseq atlas by gene expression guided integration of the two datasets (Fig. 1A, see methods). Each transcriptomically defined<nl><fcel>132<fcel>sensory neuron subtype was represented by at least one and up to 74 Patch-seq characterized<nl><fcel>133<fcel>neurons (Fig. 1B). The integration of snRNAseq and Patch-seq datasets effectively mitigated<nl><fcel>134<fcel>technical differences between the two approaches, as evidenced by the uniform distribution of cells<nl><fcel>135<fcel>from different batches and biological replicates across the integratedUMAPspace (Fig. S6). While<nl><fcel>136<fcel>we observed some expected differences in injury-induced and culturing-related genes between the<nl><fcel>137<fcel>datasets (39, 40) (Fig. S7), cell-type enriched marker genes were largely consistent between either<nl><fcel>138<fcel>technology (Fig. S8). Patch-seq cells which are mapped to the same molecular cell type display<nl><fcel>139<fcel>similar electrophysiological properties (Fig. S1).

<otsl><loc_31><loc_47><loc_440><loc_454><fcel>141 142<fcel>the same approach as reported before for human DRG neurons (29) , with identification of 5,577 putative neurons with a median of 4,597 detected UMIs and 2,138 expressed genes per spot (Fig.<nl><fcel>143<fcel>S10). Our thorough taxonomy reflects all major expected neuronal DRG populations, consisting<nl><fcel>144<fcel>of five Aβ-, four Aδ-, and seven C-fiber related neuronal subtypes (Fig. 1, supplement table 1). In<nl><fcel>145<fcel>naming the cell types in this study, we designated putative fiber types based on gene expression<nl><fcel>146<fcel>patterns, knowledge on fiber function in large mammals and through comparisons with existing<nl><fcel>147<fcel>transcriptomic datasets from large mammals, such as humans and monkeys (26, 27, 29) . With our<nl><fcel>148<fcel>approach, we were able to map distinct electrophysiological and morphological features to the<nl><fcel>149<fcel>transcriptomic identities of the sensory neurons (Fig. 1C, Fig. S1 and S9), e.g. the groups related<nl><fcel>150<fcel>to C-fibers compared to A-fibers exhibited significantly longer action potential (AP) durations<nl><fcel>151<ecel><nl><fcel>152<fcel>(Fig. 1D) and as expected, had smaller mean diameter cell bodies (Fig. S9).<nl><fcel>153<fcel>The Aβ-group of putative proprioceptors, Aβ-Proprio, displayed high expression of PVALB ,<nl><fcel>154<fcel>SPP1 and ETV1 , hyperpolarized after-hyperpolarization (AHP) minimum (-81.6 ± 1.22 mV) and<nl><fcel>155<fcel>hyperpolarized AP thresholds (-55.2 ± 4.31 mV) and large cell diameters (95 ± 3.1 µm) (Fig. 1F<nl><fcel>156<fcel>and Fig. S1, S9). We identified three low-threshold mechanoreceptor subtypes (Aβ-LTMRs),<nl><fcel>157<fcel>termed A  - LTMR-ALDH1A1, A  - LTMR-SLIT2 , and A  -LTMR-PALM, each expressing<nl><fcel>158<fcel>PIEZO2 and showing low expression of the pain related sodium channel genes SCN9A , SCN10A<nl><fcel>159<fcel>and SCN11A . The A  -fiber neuron group named A  -HTMRs likely represent high-threshold<nl><fcel>160<fcel>mechanoreceptors, marked by CPNE4 and PLXNA2 , as well as PIEZO2 , and SCN10A ,<nl><fcel>161<fcel>suggestive of a potential nociceptive function (29) .<nl><fcel>162<ecel><nl><fcel>163<fcel>We identified four A  groups: the A  -LTMR, with uniquely high expression of PIEZO2 and<nl><fcel>164<fcel>marked by PCDH7 , KCNQ3 , NTRK2 ; the A  -CACNA1E, marked by B4GALT6 , DCC , CREB5 ,<nl><fcel>165<fcel>CACNA1E , and - unique among A-fibers - by its relatively high expression of SCN10A ; the A  -<nl><fcel>166<fcel>TRPV1, marked by UNC5D and ZNF521 , and with distinctively high expression of the capsaicin<nl><fcel>167<fcel>and heat receptor TRPV1 . The A  -COOL group was marked by the cold and menthol sensitive<nl><fcel>168<fcel>ion channel TRPM8 , RORA and FOXP2 expression. They displayed a very short AP duration<nl><fcel>169<fcel>(2.01 ± 0.286 ms, Fig. 1D), low AP amplitudes (97.5 ± 2.31 mV) and the highest fraction among<nl><fcel>170<fcel>all DRG cell types for ongoing activity (61.5%, Fig. S1), potentially due to patch clamp being<nl><fcel>171<fcel>performed at room temperature which represents a tonic cold stimulus for those cells.<nl><fcel>172<ecel><nl><fcel>173<fcel>The C-fiber related groups all displayed high expression of the pain-related sodium channel<nl><fcel>174<fcel>genes SCN9A , SCN10A and SCN11A .

Finally, we identified a distinct<nl><fcel>187<fcel>C-fiber subgroup, notable for its high expression of OSMR , low expression of PIEZO2 , and<nl><fcel>188<fcel>marked by IL31RA , HRH1 (the histamine receptor), JAK1 , and NPPB . We named this subgroup<nl><fcel>189<fcel>C-OSMR-SST, given the prominent expression of SST among these cells , especially among our<nl><fcel>190<fcel>whole-cell datasets of these neurons (i.e., Patch-seq and spatial transcriptomics, Fig. 1E, Fig.<nl><fcel>191<fcel>S11). Notably, these cells expressed the highest levels of SCN11A and displayed the longest AP<nl><fcel>192<fcel>duration of any DRG cell type in our dataset (Fig. 1D).<nl><srow>193<ecel><nl><fcel>194<fcel>In summary, our pig DRG neuronal taxonomy displays marked neuronal diversity in<nl><fcel>195<fcel>transcriptomic and electrophysiological characteristics.<nl><fcel>196<fcel>Comparison of pig DRG transcriptomes to cross-species atlases (including human)<nl><fcel>197<fcel>Transcriptomic studies of sensory neurons have shown evolutionary conservation of major cell<nl><fcel>198<fcel>identities between species (25, 41) . Consequently, to contextualize our pig DRG cell type<nl><fcel>199<fcel>taxonomy in relation to homologous cell types defined in other species, including humans, we<nl><fcel>200<fcel>compared the transcriptional identities from our pig snRNAseq dataset with a recently published<nl><fcel>201<fcel>cross-species atlas of the mammalian DRG (Fig. 2A) (41) . Following the projection of our pig<nl><fcel>202<fcel>snRNAseq dataset onto this atlas (see Methods), we observed a good representation of pig<nl><fcel>203<fcel>neuronal nuclei among the cell type clusters defined in this broader cross-species atlas (Fig. 2B,<nl><fcel>204<fcel>2C).<nl><fcel>205<fcel>To quantify the comparability between the pig and cross-species DRG taxonomies, we employed<nl><fcel>206<fcel>two complementary analytical approaches. First, we used a Seurat-based label transfer method to<nl><fcel>207<fcel>project the cross-species atlas cell type labels onto our pig snRNA-seq data. This approach<nl><fcel>208<fcel>predicts cell type labels for query cells based on transcriptional similarities to the reference<nl><fcel>209<fcel>dataset. We visualized these results using a river plot (Fig. 2D), which illustrates the flow of cell<nl><fcel>210<fcel>type assignments from the cross-species classification to our original pig taxonomy. Second, we<nl><fcel>211<fcel>applied the MetaNeighbor algorithm (39) to evaluate the replicability of cell types across<nl><fcel>212<fcel>taxonomies.

To transfer this in vivo<nl><fcel>245 246<fcel>stimulation paradigm to our in vitro experiments, we applied our optimized Patch-seq<nl><fcel>247<fcel>electrophysiological characterization pipeline (Fig. 3).<nl><fcel>248<fcel>First , we applied a train of 75 suprathreshold stimulations delivered at 2 Hz to the patched cells to assess activity-dependent slowing (ADS) (n=176 cells) (42) .High amount of activity, e.g. due<nl><fcel>250<fcel>to a 2 Hz stimulation in sleeping nociceptors in human or pig skin in vivo, induces substantial<nl><fcel>251<fcel>slowing of conduction velocity (Fig. 3A,B,C, (22) ). C-OSMR-SST neurons displayed more ADS<nl><ecel><fcel>compared to other C-fiber related classes (Fig. 3D, Fig. S13). During the stimulation, the C-<nl><fcel>252<ecel><nl><fcel>253 254<fcel>OSMR-SST neurons displayed significant activity-dependent membrane potential<nl><ecel><fcel>hyperpolarization, reduced AP peak and AP maximum upstroke slope relative to other C-fiber<nl><fcel>255<fcel>cells (Fig. S13A-C).<nl><fcel>256<fcel>Second , trains of twenty sine wave and square pulses were delivered at 4 Hz (i.e., sinus score, see<nl><fcel>257<fcel>methods, n=213 cells) to assess the preference for sine waves versus square pulses observed in<nl><fcel>258<fcel>vivo for sleeping nociceptors (13, 16, 22) . The C-OSMR-SST subgroup demonstrated the highest sinus score (Fig. 3E, right ).<nl><fcel>259<ecel><nl><fcel>260<fcel>Third , trains of 20 short suprathreshold square pulses were delivered at 50 Hz (n=226 cells, Fig.<nl><fcel>261<fcel>3F), as CMi fibers in vivo are unable to respond to high frequency stimulation continuously with<nl><fcel>262<fcel>AP generation (i.e., they have a lower following frequency, (13, 16, 22) ).

As expected, the first principal component (CMi ephys PC1) accounted for the<nl><fcel>272<fcel>majority of variance in these features (49%), indicating that this component could serve as a<nl><fcel>273<fcel>single score for CMi-like neuronal identity. Leveraging gene expression profiles collected from<nl><fcel>274<fcel>the same neurons via Patch-seq, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis to identify genes<nl><fcel>275<fcel>significantly associated with CMi scores (Fig. 4B). We found a substantial overlap between these<nl><fcel>276<fcel>electrophysiology-based CMi-associated genes and markers of C-OSMR-SST neurons (Fig. 4C,<nl><fcel>277<fcel>76 genes out of 228 total CMi-associated genes, p-value for hypergeometric test = 2.34 × 10⁻⁷⁹).<nl><fcel>278<fcel>This analysis further highlighted several key pain-related ion channels, including SCN11A (Fig.<nl><fcel>279<fcel>4D) and SCN10A , suggesting that their expression is closely related to CMi-like neuronal<nl><fcel>280<fcel>characteristics and underscoring the potential future therapeutic value of targeting these channels<nl><fcel>281<fcel>(see Discussion).<nl><fcel>282<fcel>To establish a mechanistic linkage between the gene expression pattern and the functional<nl><fcel>283<fcel>phenotype of C-OSMR-SST neurons we used the expression data of these neurons from the<nl><fcel>284<fcel>snRNAseq dataset to generate a computational model based on an extension of the Hodgkin-<nl><fcel>285<fcel>Huxley approach by using the modeling framework from (43) (see methods). In this model, for<nl><fcel>286<fcel>instance, reduction of the SCN11A conductance of 50% leads to a strong reduction of the action<nl><fcel>287<fcel>potential duration from 1.34ms to 1.18 ms (Fig. 4E, Fig. S14). The long action potential duration as well as the action potential slope of C-OSMR-SST neurons was highly dependent on the<nl><fcel>288<ecel><nl><fcel>289<fcel>expression of SCN11A, suggesting this channel is a key player in shaping the characteristic<nl><fcel>290 291<fcel>functional phenotype of CMi fibers. Altogether, our in vitro experiments, modeled on adapted in vivo microneurography stimulation<nl><fcel>292<fcel>protocols, demonstrate that C-OSMR-SST neurons exhibit functional properties similar to those<nl><fcel>293<fcel>of CMi-fibers identified in human skin in vivo .<nl><fcel>294<ecel><nl><fcel>295<fcel>OSM selectively modifies CMi-fibers in vivo in humans<nl><fcel>296<ecel><nl><fcel>298<fcel>defined CMi-fibers in pigs and humans.

<section_header_level_1><loc_32><loc_47><loc_119><loc_54>DISCUSSION 325</section_header_level_1>
<otsl><loc_31><loc_49><loc_442><loc_438><fcel>325<ecel><nl><fcel>326<fcel>The research described here presents a major advance in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of sensory neurobiology and pain. We have defined a population of neurons<nl><fcel>327<ecel><nl><fcel>328<fcel>consistent with the elusive population of human dermal sleeping nociceptors, i.e., mechano-<nl><fcel>330<fcel>single-cell transcriptomic techniques in pigs and humans. The unique strength and unprecedented<nl><fcel>331<fcel>translational power of our data set lies in the direct link between functional and transcriptomic<nl><fcel>332<fcel>data for each identified sensory neuron subtype. This allows us to paint the complex picture of<nl><fcel>333<fcel>the molecular and functional identity of the CMis in human skin, laying the basis for drug target<nl><ecel><fcel>identification, which may counteract their spontaneous activity observed during neuropathic pain<nl><fcel>334 335<fcel>but keeps the warning function for potentially tissue damaging stimuli via other nociceptive<nl><fcel>336<fcel>neurons functional (1-4) .<nl><fcel>337<ecel><nl><fcel>338<fcel>C-OSMR-SST, the subgroup identified as CMis, express the highest level of SCN11A , coding for<nl><fcel>339<fcel>the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.9, which has been discussed intensely as drug target for<nl><fcel>340<fcel>neuropathic pain (45, 46) . We hypothesize that this channel, in combination with other channels<nl><fcel>341<fcel>expressed in this neuron type, including SCN10A/ Nav1.8, gives rise to the distinct functional<nl><fcel>342<fcel>characteristics of C-OSMR-SST neurons, including sine wave sensitivity and formation of very<nl><fcel>343<fcel>broad APs (45, 47) . We included the sodium channel expression identified in this manuscript<nl><fcel>344<fcel>into a basic computer model of CMi-fibers, based on (43) . We identify the surprising<nl><fcel>345<fcel>contribution of Nav1.9 to the steepness of the AP upstroke and the shoulder. Our findings thus<nl><fcel>346<fcel>underscore the prominent role of Nav1.9 in CMi fiber electrogenesis and the promise for<nl><fcel>347<fcel>developing modulators of Nav1.9 channel function, as these might be especially effective in<nl><fcel>348<fcel>silencing sleeping nociceptors. It is highly likely that more targets will emerge from our data set,<nl><fcel>349<fcel>and future studies may show their translational and therapeutic potential.<nl><fcel>350<ecel><nl><fcel>351<fcel>OSM reduces activity dependent slowing and thus enhances excitability of CMis. Given the<nl><fcel>352<fcel>involvement of OSM in the JAK pathway (48) and the high JAK1 Expression in the C-OSM-<nl><fcel>353<fcel>SST subgroup, we speculate that the pathway we identified as molecular marker, involving JAK,<nl><fcel>354<fcel>could be a potentially sensitizing pathway, which may change the CMi-fiber to a more CM-fiber<nl><fcel>355<fcel>like phenotype during pathophysiological processes. A subset of CMi-fibers, which are<nl><fcel>356<fcel>histamine sensitive, are associated with itch, and JAK-inhibitors are in clinical use as antipruritic<nl><fcel>357<fcel>agents (49) . The specific mechanisms of the contribution of CMi-fibers to itch and neuropathic<nl><fcel>358<fcel>pain still remains to be elucidated. Interfering with JAK signaling may prevent CMi-fiber<nl><fcel>359<fcel>sensitization and thus may potentially counteract the development of neuropathic pain and<nl><fcel>360<fcel>chronic itch beyond its known anti-inflammatory effects (50, 51) .<nl><fcel>361<ecel><nl><fcel>362<fcel>Our human experiments using microneurography demonstrate that CMis are responsive to<nl><fcel>363<fcel>application of OSM, thus substantiating our transcriptomic inference that these cells express<nl><fcel>364<fcel>OSMR. However, further disentangling how the application of OSM changes CMis, and<nl><fcel>365<fcel>critically, whether OSM sensitizes CMis in the response to stimuli such as mechanical<nl><fcel>366<fcel>stimulation, inflammatory agents, cold, heat, remains to be investigated and is beyond the scope<nl><fcel>367<fcel>of the current study. We recognize that OSM-induced skin erythema in human volunteers<nl><fcel>368<fcel>stretched out far beyond the actual injection site with blurred borders.

However, some genes, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor<nl><fcel>375<fcel>CHRNA3 , were previously identified as a marker of sleeping nociceptors in mice (17, 53) , but we<nl><fcel>376<fcel>did not detect it in either of the three pig datasets presented in this study. In mice this neuronal<nl><fcel>377<fcel>subgroup is mechano-insensitive in dissociated cultures but expresses nociceptor-related gene<nl><fcel>378<fcel>products (17) . These cells have few, if any, cutaneous afferents in mice. In line with this finding,<nl><fcel>379<fcel>cutaneous sleeping nociceptors have been challenging to detect thus far in murine skin tissues in<nl><fcel>380<fcel>contrast to humans and pig (54) . Beside CHRNA3 , recently, TMEM100 has been described as a<nl><fcel>381<fcel>marker involved in unsilencing of CHRNA3 + neurons in mice (53) . As in human sensory<nl><fcel>382<fcel>neurons (27) , in our pig dataset TMEM100 is expressed at very low levels in any neuron<nl><fcel>383<fcel>type. We thus assume, that the transcriptomic identities of sleeping nociceptors differ between<nl><fcel>384<fcel>skin and deep somatic tissues, or that CMi-fibers of mice and large, fur lacking mammals such as<nl><fcel>385<fcel>human and pigs, differ significantly (17, 54) .<nl><srow>386<ecel><nl><fcel>387<fcel>A subset of CMi fibers can be activated by intense heating of the skin, typically at an average<nl><fcel>388<fcel>surface temperature of 48.0 ± 3.0°C (9). However, this temperature threshold is painful for most<nl><fcel>389<fcel>individuals, poses a risk of skin damage, and may not generate high enough temperatures in<nl><fcel>390<fcel>deeper layers of the skin. Notably, intracutaneous injections of capsaicin in human skin activate<nl><fcel>391<fcel>nearly all CMi fibers (13) suggesting that this fiber class could be triggered by heat stimuli if<nl><fcel>392<fcel>they could be applied deeply enough in the skin.<nl><fcel>393<fcel>As expected with our use of the 10X Genomics Single Cell 3' Kit, snRNAseq read coverage is<nl><fcel>394<fcel>biased towards the 3' ends of gene bodies. Upon qualitative inspection, we observed that some<nl><fcel>395<fcel>genes, including SCNA10A and TRPV1, exhibit unannotated reads in their 3' UTRs . We believe<nl><fcel>396<fcel>this is likely due to incomplete annotation of the 3' UTRs in the reference transcriptome used.<nl><fcel>397<fcel>However, this issue appears to be gene-specific, as other manually assessed genes, such as<nl><fcel>398<fcel>CALCB, OSMR, and SST, do not show similar evidence of unannotated reads. Despite potential<nl><fcel>399<fcel>suboptimal annotation for TRPV1 in pigs, we detected TRPV1 transcripts in a significant<nl><fcel>400<fcel>number of C-OSMR-SST neurons, which aligns with human microneurography data showing<nl><fcel>401<fcel>heat responsiveness in most CMi fibers.<nl><srow>402<ecel><nl><fcel>403<fcel>In designating fiber types such as Aβ-, Aδ-, and C-fibers in our study, we relied on gene<nl><fcel>404<fcel>expression profiles and comparisons with existing transcriptomic datasets from large mammals<nl><fcel>405<fcel>as well as on knowledge on fiber function in these species. While this allowed us to align our<nl><fcel>406<fcel>classifications with well-characterized clusters, we acknowledge that distinguishing certain fiber<nl><fcel>407<fcel>types, such as Aδ- from C-fibers, remains challenging due to overlapping gene expression<nl><fcel>408<fcel>patterns and species-specific differences (55) .<nl><srow>409<ecel><nl><fcel>410<fcel>The cell type identified with the highest transcriptomic similarities to the C-OSMR-SST cells are<nl><fcel>411<fcel>the C-OSMR-GFRA1/2 neurons.

After<nl><fcel>640<fcel>second strand synthesis and denaturation (Step 2), the samples were prepared for a full-length<nl><fcel>641<fcel>cDNA amplification via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (step 3). Afterwards, a Visium<nl><fcel>642<fcel>spatial gene expression library was generated (step 4), followed by sequencing (step 5). Steps 4<nl><fcel>643<fcel>and 5 were performed at the Genomics Core facilities of the University of Texas at Dallas. The<nl><fcel>644<fcel>samples were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq2000 Sequencing system.<nl><fcel>645<fcel>Visium spatial RNA-seq analysis<nl><fcel>646<fcel>From our sequencing run, we obtained a total average of 59,081,551 Mreads, 86.51% of the<nl><fcel>647<fcel>reads were mapped with 84.22% confidence. We detected an average of 13,870 genes and 1574<nl><fcel>648<fcel>barcodes under tissue. The mean of reads per barcode was 40,490, and the median of Unique<nl><fcel>649<fcel>Molecule Identifier (UMI) counts per spot was 2,819. The generated Illumina BCL files were<nl><fcel>650<fcel>processed with the 10XGenomics pipeline (Space Ranger v1.1). This pipeline allowed the<nl><fcel>651<fcel>alignment of the FASTQ files with bright-field microscope images and the pig reference<nl><fcel>652<fcel>transcriptome (Sscofra11.1). Using the Loupe Browser (v4.2.0, 10x Genomics), we visualized<nl><fcel>653<fcel>the location of the barcoded mRNAs for downstream analysis by selecting the barcoded spots<nl><fcel>654<fcel>overlapping single neurons. We identified 6408 barcodes overlapping single neurons and 12,304<nl><fcel>655<fcel>overlapping multiple barcodes. To avoid double counts, we excluded the barcodes overlapping<nl><fcel>656<fcel>multiple neurons. As part of a quality control step, we removed neuronal barcodes with less than<nl><fcel>657<fcel>a hundred reads and no counts of the neuronal marker Synaptosome Associated Protein 25<nl><fcel>658<fcel>( SNAP25 ) using Python (v3.8 with Anaconda distribution).<nl><fcel>659<fcel>Visium spatial morphology measurements<nl><fcel>660<fcel>We compiled a .csv file containing the positional data (coordinates) of barcodes overlapping with<nl><fcel>661<fcel>single neurons per Visium capture frame.

MetaNeighbor constructs a network of rank<nl><fcel>738<fcel>correlations among all cells based on shared variable genes, using the principle that cells<nl><fcel>739<fcel>belonging to the same subtype exhibit more correlated gene expression patterns than distinct cell<nl><fcel>740<fcel>types.

<text><loc_59><loc_269><loc_443><loc_398>( A ) Schematic illustrating the use of oncostatin-M (OSM) during human superficial blood flow measurements. ( B ) Injection of OSM induces an axon reflex erythema of 275 ± 108.3 mm 2  (n=4) in human skin after 24 h. Images show superficial blood flow (lower) and corresponding photographs (upper) of one participant's forearms at 24 h after injection (500 ng right distal, 250 ng left proximal). Lower panels show close-ups of injection site in right arm. ( C ) Schematic illustrating the use of oncostatin-M (OSM) during human microneurography experiments. OSM and electrical stimulation are applied to C-fiber nerve endings while AP responses of corresponding C-fiber axon(s) to the constant low frequency electrical stimulation are recorded simultaneously. ( D ) Microneurography recordings of two CMi- and two CM-fibers before (large colored circles) and 7 min after injection of 500 ng OSM (small black markers). Y-axis indicates differences in ADS as change in relative AP latency following delivery of 0.125 Hz test pulses. Following application of OSM, characteristic ADS is abolished in CMis but no change in ADS is observed in CMs. ( E ) Microneurography recordings of a CMi- (green) and CM-fiber (orange) before and after intraepidermal OSM injection during repetitive stimulation with 0.25 Hz. Subsequent response latencies of electrically induced APs are shown normalized to baseline latency determined before pulse 374. The CMi-fiber undergoes ADS during initial pulses. The CM fiber is mechanically activated by injection, as seen by a sudden latency increase followed by normalisation, and afterwards, ADS is stable. In contrast, the mechano-insensitive CMi-fiber is not activated by the mechanical aspect of injection but shows unstable latency afterwards. Some of these instabilities may be occurrence of spurious OSM induced discharges and numerous conduction failures following OSM injection, demonstrating an affection of CMi- but not CM-fibers by OSM injection.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_296><loc_441><loc_388>Graphical abstract: Identifying the molecular identity of mechano-insensitive C-fibers. 1) Mechano-insensitive Cfibers (CMis) are traditionally defined functionally in vivo using specific electrical stimulation protocols applied to the skin. These protocols, activity dependent slowing (ADS), including sinusoidal and repetitive stimulation, distinguish CMis from mechano-sensitive C-fibers (CMs) in large mammals, including humans and pigs. 2) We used Patch-seq to characterize pig DRG neuron subtypes for whether they might be CMis. Current injection protocols applied in vitro were adapted from the stimulation protocols used to distinguish CMis in vivo . Following electrophysiological characterization, mRNA from neurons was harvested for sequencing. 3) We developed a novel multi-modal comparative/cross-species DRG neuronal taxonomy, encompassing single-nucleus RNAseq, Patch-seq, and Visium-based spatial transcriptomics in pigs and humans. This taxonomy enabled us to assess the putative CMi identity of each DRG molecular neuronal type. A distinct C-fiber molecular type, characterized by expression of OSMR and IL31RA , most likely reflects CMis. 4) Applying the OSMR ligand oncostatin M, to human subjects in vivo demonstrated a selective response to OSM by CMis but not CMs highlighting OSMR as key molecular marker of CMis.</text>
