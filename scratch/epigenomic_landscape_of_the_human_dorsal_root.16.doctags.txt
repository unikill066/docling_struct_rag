<text><loc_37><loc_149><loc_452><loc_244>Cell states are influenced by the regulation of gene expression orchestrated by transcription factors capable of binding to accessible DNA regions. To uncover if sex differences exist in chromatin accessibility in the human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG), where nociceptive neurons innervating the body are found, we performed bulk and spatial assays for transposase-accessible chromatin technology followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq) from organ donors without a history of chronic pain. Using bulk ATAC-seq, we detected abundant sex differences in the hDRG. In women, differentially accessible regions (DARs) mapped mostly to the X chromosome, whereas in men, they mapped to autosomal genes. Hormone-responsive transcription factor binding motifs such as EGR1/3 were abundant within DARs in women, while JUN, FOS, and other activating protein 1 factor motifs were enriched in men, suggesting a higher activation state of cells compared with women. These observations were consistent with spatial ATAC-seq data. Furthermore, we validated that EGR1 expression is biased to female hDRG using RNAscope. In neurons, spatial ATAC-seq revealed higher chromatin accessibility in GABAergic, glutamatergic, and interferon-related genes in women and in Ca 2 1 -signalingrelated genes in men. Strikingly, XIST, responsible for inactivating 1 X chromosome by compacting it and maintaining at the periphery of the nucleus, was found to be highly dispersed in female neuronal nuclei. This is likely related to the higher chromatin accessibility in X in female hDRG neurons observed using both ATAC-seq approaches. We have documented baseline epigenomic sex differences in the hDRG which provide important descriptive information to test future hypotheses.</text>

<text><loc_251><loc_298><loc_457><loc_372>Studies in humans demonstrate sex differences in gene expression for transcription factors and epigenetic remodelers in human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) from thoracic vertebrectomy patients with chronic pain. 55,64 Moreover, in human tibial nerve and hDRG, as well as in the mouse DRG, there are sex differences in gene expression in individuals without any pain history suggesting underlying epigenetic differences at baseline that cause these divergent patterns of gene expression. 41,47,55,63,64,78,79 Decoding if sex differences in chromatin organization exist in hDRG before the onset of pathological pain can give insight into how and why these differences emerge.</text>
<text><loc_251><loc_374><loc_457><loc_462>Chromatin is a macromolecular complex found within the nuclear space composed of DNA, RNAs, and proteins. Epigenetic marks, like histone and DNA modifications, affect the degree of DNA compaction resulting in accessible regions termed euchromatin or compact regions called heterochromatin. 3 Chromatin accessibility is defined as the extent to which nuclear macromolecules can physically interact with DNA. 35 Besides its structural role, chromatin is also a dynamic entity that responds to cellular needs including transcription, DNA repair, and differentiation. 44,49 Dynamic changes in chromatin occur in the DRG in response to nerve injury and inflammation in animal models, demonstrating a functional role of epigenomic changes in chronic pain. 12,25,38,42,46,75,83,84 To date, very little is known</text>

A previous study using microarray-based genomic and mRNA expression profiling found that expression quantitative trait loci help predict the contribution of genomic loci to pain phenotypes and are associated with open chromatin regions. 57 The identification of open chromatin is routinely measured with assays for transposase-accessible chromatin technology followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq). 8 A study of the human trigeminal ganglion (TG) found an association between single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) open chromatin and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with migraine. 89</text>
<text><loc_43><loc_114><loc_249><loc_168>We hypothesized that we would detect sex differences in the epigenomic landscape of the hDRG. We used bulk and spatial ATAC-seq coupled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to map the open chromatin accessibility landscape of female and male hDRG. We found pervasive differences in transcriptional regulatory programs between women and men that likely have important implications for understanding epidemiological and mechanism-based differences in nociceptive pain.</text>

Using scissors, tissue was chopped in 2 mL of ice-cold nuclei isolation buffer. 48 This buffer contained: 250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, and 0.1% triton X-100. The total volume was transferred to a Dounce homogenizer. Overall, 5 strokes of the loose pestle and 15 strokes of the tight pestle were applied. 21 The homogenate was transferred to a conical tube and centrifuged at 100 g for 8 minutes at 4˚C. The supernatant was carefully removed without disrupting the soft pellet. Next, the pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of nuclei isolation buffer free of triton. After centrifugation at 100 g for 8 minutes at 4˚C, the supernatant was removed without disrupting the pellet.</text>

Then, a tissue permeabilization step was performed using 0.1% NP40 for 15 minutes. Tn5 transposition on the fixed hDRG sections was carried out for 30 minutes. Adapters containing a ligation linker were added to the preparation to be inserted in accessible genomic loci. Barcodes with linkers were introduced using microchannels and were ligated to the 5 9 end of the Tn5 oligo through successive rounds of ligation. Human dorsal root ganglion sections were imaged to correlate spatially barcoded accessible chromatin with tissue morphology. A barcoded tissue mosaic was created, and reverse cross-linking was performed to release DNA fragments, which were then amplified through PCR for subsequent library preparation. Furthermore, 150 3 150 paired-end sequencing was performed using NextSeq 2000 with 15% PhiX. Sequencing depth was up to 300 million reads per hDRG section.</text>

We removed adapters using TrimGalore-0.6.6 and verified the quality of trimming using FastQC v0.11.7. Pairedend reads were mapped to the reference genome GRCh38/hg38 using Bowtie2. To remove unmapped reads, low-quality reads, or reads that mapped to mitochondrial DNA and PCR duplicates, we used Bamtools. Areas of open chromatin were identified by peak calling for each sample using Macs2 v.2.2.7.1 in keeping with Galaxy ATAC-seq data analysis.</text>
<text><loc_32><loc_238><loc_238><loc_361>Differential accessibility between male and female donors was analyzed using DiffBind, a package within the Bioconductor framework.

The definitions of annotations were acquired in a default mode. Processing of transcription factor binding sites was performed using Transcription factor Occupancy prediction By Investigation of ATAC-seq Signal (TOBIAS 5 ) in conjunction with human consensus transcription factor motifs from JASPAR. In brief, ATACorrect parameter was used to assess and correct the Tn5 transposase sequence preference of cutting sites. Putative transcription factor binding sites or transcription factor occupancy within peak regions were estimated using FootprintScore. Differential transcription factor binding sites in ATAC-seq reads between male and female hDRG were detected with BINDetect.

Two sections per hDRG separated by at least 100 m m from each other were obtained to capture 2 sets of neurons allowing for a diverse population to be analyzed. Sections were fixed in cold 10% formalin pH 7.4 for 15 minutes and then dehydrated sequentially in 50% ethanol for 5 minutes, 70% ethanol for 5 minutes, and 100% ethanol for 10 minutes at RT.

The 2 images underwent the application of Gaussian Blur with sigma values 1 and 2, respectively. The 2 resulting images with blurs were subtracted using the built-in Image Calculator feature in ImageJ Fiji which allowed for the detection of in situ hybridization puncta using the default threshold function. Thresholding values that allowed for as little noise as possible without compromising the signal were chosen for each channel. The Analyze Particles feature was used to analyze the number of puncta. The count readout was extracted from the images across the 10 donors which were then used to plot EGR1 puncta count in SCN10A positive or negative neurons for each sex. EGR1 puncta count data are presented as violin plots with thick line indicating the median and dotted lines indicating the quartiles.</text>

<text><loc_43><loc_259><loc_249><loc_479><loc_262><loc_38><loc_468><loc_168>To characterize the epigenetic landscape of the hDRG, we performed ATAC-seq, 9 an unbiased approach to assess chromatin accessibility regions within the genome 70 on lumbar hDRG from 9 donors (N 5 5 women, N 5 4 men, Fig. 1A ). This assay does not require prior knowledge of the epigenetic state of cells or the fine-tuning of transcription factors regulating gene expression. 27 Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin technology followed by sequencing leverages the efficient insertion of the cleavage enzyme Tn5 into DNA located in open chromatin regions. The molecular event of recognizing and cleaving DNA and adding Tn5 overhangs at the 5 9 and 3 9 ends of DNA is known as transposition ( Fig. 1B ). Donor information for all the samples that were used for bulk ATAC in hDRG is shown in Table S1, http://links.lww.com/PAIN/C195. After peak calling, we obtained a total of 669,749 peaks in female and 506,435 in male hDRG samples. At the global level, the distribution of called peaks in both female and male hDRG samples is concentrated near the transcription start site (TSS), with a notable accumulation of ATAC-seq signal directly at the TSS rather than in the immediate vicinity ( Fig. 1C ). The transcription start site enrichment (TSSe) score is an important quality control parameter in ATAC-seq that measures the ATAC-seq signal enrichment in the areas surrounding the reference set of TSSs in the genome. It is calculated as the sequencing depth for each 100 bp in the window within 1000 or 2000 bp on each side of the TSS normalized by the sequencing depth at the end flanks (100 bp at each end of the TSS). After computing the average score for each window around the TSS, the maximum value is considered as the TSSe score. As the TSSs are generally active regions in the DNA, they are expected to be enriched in accessible chromatin. We obtained a mean TSSe score of 3.17 ( Fig. 1D ), similar to other reports using postmortem human tissue. 13,32 Fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP), defined as the measure of how many of the total reads are located within the peaks, was greater than 0.13 on average. By mapping ATAC-seq peaks to genomic regions, we found that ; 15%of peaks mapped within the putative promoter, ; 40%were in distal intergenic regions, and ; 35%were found in introns ( Fig. 1E ). The enrichment of accessible chromatin in intergenic regions suggests that distal regulatory sequences, such as enhancers and noncoding regulatory elements in cis , can be accessed to regulate gene expression. In many cases, peaks located mainly in promoters, 74 but also those harbored in the gene body (introns and exons) have been found to be good predictors of gene expression. 28 However, the proof of concept for the functionality of enhancers is tissue-specific and requires further experimentation. 80 As our results show that, at the global level, chromatin accessibility in hDRG showed similar annotation to called peaks between sexes, and the proportion was typical to other ATAC-seq reports, 88 we aimed to conduct a sex-specific analysis identifying specific genes to investigate whether sex differences in pain could be associated with chromatin structure.</text>

<text><loc_262><loc_196><loc_468><loc_354>By comparing ATAC-seq peaks in female and male samples, we found 3005 differentially accessible chromatin regions (DARs, false discovery rate (FDR) , 0.01, Fig. 2A ; complete DAR list is supplied in Dataset S1, http://links.lww.com/PAIN/C195). Amongthese, 41 were identified as gene promoters in the female hDRG. Notably, most DARs were located on the X chromosome in genes such as MAPD72 , FRMPD4, PORCN, PNMA3, and TKTL1 ( Fig. 2A ). In men, 234 DARs were associated with gene promoters ( 6 1 kb from TSS) on autosomal chromosomes and included genes such as NR1D1 , IRF2 , CCNB1 , DAPK3 , and FOXO1 ( Fig. 2A , promoter DAR list is supplied in Dataset S2, http://links.lww.com/PAIN/C195). The ATAC-seq principal component analysis ( Fig. 2B ) demonstrated that female and male samples clustered separately, consistent with the DAR analysis results. Representative sex-biased DARs around the TSS in female and male hDRG are shown in Figures 2C and D , respectively. X inactivation is known to balance X chromosome gene expression between sexes, although it is incomplete in some tissues and new regulatory functions associated with escape from X inactivation are still being discovered. 69 We observed a striking number of DARs in this chromosome in the female DRG likely consistent with a lack of X silencing in the hDRG in women or the presence of poised genes ready to be activated.</text>

For this analysis, differential binding scores with 2 log10 ( P -value) larger than the 95th percentiles (top 5% in each direction) were considered significant. 5 In women, transcription factors of the early growth response (EGR) family such as EGR1 and EGR3, and members of the specificity protein (SP) family such as SP1, SP2, SP4, and SP9 footprints were more abundant compared with men. In men, we found a higher level of footprints for transcription factors that are part of the activating protein 1 (AP-1) family such as Jun Proto-Oncogene (JUN), Fos</text>

During the extension of PCR amplification, the Tn5 enzymatic cleavage left behind is filled in. Then, also during the PCR, the fragments are barcoded with Illumina adapters and amplified.

Together, these results suggest that women and men have different transcriptional activation programs. Whether these pathways play a role in sex differences in response to injury when additional transcription factors might be activated in these cells still needs to be investigated. However, it is a testable hypothesis that these baseline differences in molecular profiles could drive sex dimorphisms in pathological pain conditions.</text>

<text><loc_43><loc_100><loc_249><loc_341>In addition to neurons, there are at least 8 broadly defined cell types in hDRG. 7,34,54 This high hDRG cellular heterogeneity was also observed at the epigenomic level because unsupervised cell clustering in spatial ATAC-seq samples identified 9 groups of cells ( Fig. 4A ). Cluster 1 was classified as a neuronal cluster due to the abundance of chromatin accessibility in the SNAP25 gene compared with other cell types. Furthermore, this cluster also showschromatin activity for CALCA and SCN10A consistent with a neuronal phenotype ( Figs. 4B-D ). Cluster 2 showed enriched chromatin accessibility for the marker of satellite glial cells (SGCs), FABP7 ( Fig. 4E ). The chromatin accessibility profile for cluster 3 had CD300LB, IFI30 , C5AR1 , C1QB, and ABI3 amongthe top 30 most active genes, all of which are expressed by immune cells in the hDRG 7 ( Fig. 4F ). According to the hDRG harmonized atlas, 7 the top 30 most active genes for the cluster 5 exhibited enrichment for immune-related genes, such as OLR1 , MS4A7 , TYROBP, and CORO1A . Interestingly, this cluster also showed enrichment for macrophage markers such as CD163, ARHGAP30, SIRPB2, and PLCB2 . Thus, we classified cluster 5 as immune macrophage enriched ( Fig. 4G ). Cluster 6 showed enriched chromatin accessibility in SCN7A likely representing the nonmyelinating Schwann cell cluster ( Fig. 4H ). Cluster 7 showed enriched chromatin accessibility in PRX and MPZ representing the myelinating Schwann cell cluster ( Fig. 4I ). A fibroblast cluster was identified by the gene activity of DCN and FMOD in cluster 8 ( Fig. 4J ). Cluster 9 was identified as the endothelial cluster due to abundant CLDN5 gene accessibility ( Fig. 4K ). Cluster 4 was more challenging to classify. This cluster showed chromatin accessibility in genes such as PODN and FOXD1 , which are expressed in fibroblasts in hDRG suggesting this cluster is composed of a subtype of fibroblast in the hDRG. Cell type composition in hDRG shows consistent cluster proportion between samples and sexes ( Fig. 4L ). The number of unique fragments per barcode exceeded the minimum values required to be considered high quality in all the clusters (log10 nFrag 5 3,</text>

In Figure 5A , we show that the number of fragments per barcode and the distribution of reads in the UMAP were similar between female and male hDRG samples ( Fig. 5B ). Our analysis showed DARs in 3796 genes in female hDRG vs 3827 genes in men ( Fig. 5C ). In women, a significant proportion of DARs was located on the X chromosome consistent with our bulk ATAC-seq findings ( Fig. 5D ). These findings align with our bulk ATAC-seq results. Genes such as NONO , MAPD7 , FRMPD4 , PORCN , FGF13, and TKTL1 shown in female bulk ATAC-seqwerealsofoundtobedifferentially accessible in female spatial ATAC-seq data. Spatial ATAC-seq also revealed female DARs in genes outside the X chromosome such as ERBB4 , GABAergic genes including GABRG1/2 , GABRA5 , GABRB3 , GABRB1 , GABRA2/4 , and other neuronal genes such as (Brainderived neurotrophic factor) BDNF , BDNF-AS , RELN , SCN9A , GRIA4, and GRIN2B (Dataset S3, http://links.lww.com/PAIN/ C195). It is important to mention that most of these genes are also significantly differentially accessible when only autosomes are analyzed, which validates our results (data not shown).</text>

Furthermore, a considerable amount of the genes with DARs in promoters in our bulk ATAC-seq data were also found to be biased towards men in the spatial ATACseq. We found male hDRG DAR-associated genes such as FOS , FOSL2 , NR1D1 , IRF2, and FOXO1 . The male hDRG DAR list also included genes encoding for neurotrophic tyrosine kinase gene NTRK1 and cation channels such as TRPV2/4 .

<text><loc_43><loc_433><loc_249><loc_465><loc_262><loc_363><loc_468><loc_465>One of the outcomes that showed consistency in bulk and spatial ATAC-seq was the bias toward women in the footprint scores for the transcription factor EGR1 in hDRG, and specifically in neurons. With the aim of validating this consistent finding, we sought to assess the expression of EGR1 in hDRG using in situ hybridization. We found that EGR1 is expressed in female and male hDRG SCN10A ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) neurons, but also in cells surrounding neurons, likely satellite glial or immune cells ( Figs. 7A and B ). We quantified the number of EGR1 mRNAs localized to hDRG neurons and found it to be more abundant in women compared with men ( Fig. 7C ). This sexual dimorphism was statistically significant in SCN10A ( 1 ), but not SCN10A ( 2 ) cells in women ( Figs. 7D and E ). Our analysis also showed that women have a higher number of EGR1 ( 1 ) SCN10A ( 1 ) cells compared with men (57.9% vs 29.71%, respectively, Fig. 7F ). These results are consistent with our datasets. The combined identification of EGR1 female-biased expression and the prominent abundance of regulatory binding sites in female hDRG renders the transcriptional activity of EGR1 a strong candidate for a femalebiased regulator of gene expression in hDRG neurons.</text>

Although XIST is generally considered an exclusive long noncoding RNA in women, XIST has been shown to be lowly expressed in male nerve tissue. 68 We performed in situ hybridization for XIST in female and male hDRG.

Instead, the XIST signal was dispersed covering most of the nuclear compartment ( Fig. 8B ). This phenomenon was observed in SCN10A ( 1 ) and SCN10A ( 2 ) cells, where XIST spanned approximately 80% of the nuclear space. This observation was different in the cells surrounding the neurons, where the XIST signal was more confined, being restricted to around 20% of the nuclear space ( Fig. 8C ). As expected, compared with women, XIST was barely detected in male hDRG (Fig. S5, http://links.lww.com/PAIN/C196).

Future experiments will be required to understand X inactivation mechanisms in hDRG neurons and how these impact gene expression levels in the female hDRG in physiological and pathological conditions. It is notable that animal models of pain have found the participation of XIST in inflammatory chronic pain. 40,73,76,86 Understanding this phenomenon in humans will lead to better insight into a potentially primed, accessible state for many genes ready to be activated by specific signals in the X chromosome in female hDRG.</text>

<section_header_level_1><loc_43><loc_38><loc_96><loc_43>4. Discussion</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_43><loc_48><loc_249><loc_212>Our work provides a comprehensive view of the chromatin accessibility profile in hDRG and focuses on sex differences in tissues recovered from organ donors without any history of chronic pain or neuropathy. We mapped the accessible DNA in hDRG using 2 different approaches, bulk and spatial ATAC-seq. The latter approach resolved hDRG chromatin accessible profiles in distinct cell types where we focused on neuronal signatures. First, our work shows a dimorphism at the chromatin level between sexes in hDRG. This dimorphism is largely influenced by the X chromosome in female hDRG suggesting a reduced X inactivation or a dormant transcriptional state that can readily become activated under certain circumstances. Second, our ATAC-seq data show a sex dimorphic signature in transcription factor bindings sites in accessible chromatin. EGR and SP motifs were more prominent in female hDRG, while AP-1 and IRF were more abundant in males. Finally, our work shows sex differences in neuronal chromatin using spatial ATAC-seq. In neurons, sex differences were partly driven by the X chromosome in women but using this approach we also uncovered differences in autosomal genes. GABA-A channels and glutamatergic genes were the molecular ontologies associated with accessible DNA in women, while voltage-gated Ca 2 1 and K 1 channel genes as well as GTP-associated proteins were associated with male hDRG open chromatin.</text>
<text><loc_43><loc_214><loc_249><loc_388>Our bulk ATAC-seq findings point to a high chromatin accessibility in the X chromosome in women. Independently, spatial ATAC-seq confirmed this finding. It is known that 1 of the 2 X chromosomes in women is epigenetically silenced to compensate for the imbalance of X dosage between sexes. 61 X inactivation is triggered by the upregulation of XIST early in development. XIST coats 1 of the X chromosomes in cis 66,71 inducing X heterochromatization through repressive epigenetic signatures. 59 Interestingly, a small subgroup of genes escapes inactivation and has epigenetic marks of active transcription, allowing gene expression from the inactive X (Xi) chromosome. 2 Our findings are consistent with previous observations showing tissue-specific varying levels of X inactivation in human tissues. 82 Strikingly, XIST was found highly dispersed in the neuronal nuclei but not in the nuclei of surrounding cells in hDRG. XIST dispersion has been observed in human pluripotent cells, 17 where it has been hypothesized that XIST regulates autosomal genes in women. Our results are also consistent with a recent study showing greater variability in X inactivation in excitatory neurons in the human brain suggesting enhanced expression of genes from this chromosome in women in this population of neurons that share a glutamatergic biochemical phenotype with DRG neurons. 87 Importantly, a previous study linked X inactivation escape in blood cells to the development of chronic pain after a motor vehicle accident supporting the relevance of this line of investigation to pain. 90</text>
<text><loc_43><loc_389><loc_249><loc_479><loc_262><loc_38><loc_468><loc_133>A fundamental challenge in pain research is identifying why women are more predisposed to pain. Studies in rodents have described that rapid transcriptional changes occur in DRG after injury suggesting a fast onset of transcriptional reprogramming. 11 A similar process could occur in humans and given the differences in the epigenetic landscape of the hDRG observed here, a testable hypothesis would be that this response could differ between men and women. We observed higher chromatin accessibility in women in genes coding for GABA-A receptor subunits, glutamatergic, and interferon-related genes, some of which are located on the X chromosome. This difference in interferon-related genes has been found in previous studies of the immune system. 23 Furthermore, previous findings from our group showed that interferon-related genes are more highly expressed in female hDRG from neuropathic pain patients undergoing thoracic vertebrectomy surgery. 64 Someof the female-biased genes were associated with DARs on autosomes, such as GABRA5 . It has been shown that the a 5-GABAA receptor (encoded by the Gabra5 gene in mice) is more highly expressed in the female rodent DRG where it plays an important role in pain signaling and is epigenetically regulated in a sex-specific fashion. 19,20 We also found higher accessibility in autosomal BDNF -AS , a BDNF suppressor. BDNF is released from primary afferents 37 binding to TrkB in spinal cord neurons regulating synaptic plasticity important for chronic pain. 14 Therefore, BDNF -AS could be an unappreciated suppressor of BDNF expression in women, a relevant finding because the role of BDNF signaling is more prominent in nociceptive signaling in male humans 15 and rodents. 43,53</text>
<text><loc_262><loc_135><loc_468><loc_244>At the level of transcription factor footprints, EGR1/3 and SP showed higher abundance in female-accessible DNA in hDRG. In agreement with this, EGR1 expression was higher in women. A recent study found that the expression of Egr1 is driven by female sex hormones and acts as a chromatin modifier in a sex-specific fashion, 65 suggesting its pivotal role in controlling neuronal gene expression in women. Our data show that EGR1 binding sites are found in genes like JAK1, consistent with human thoracic vertebrectomy DRG data showing that interferon and JAK-STAT signaling are associated with neuropathic pain in women. 64 In addition, consistent with our findings, SP4 has a higher expression in female tibial nerve compared with men. 63 SP4 regulates the transcription of genes that act as sensors of noxious stimuli 12 suggesting an important role of this protein to the transduction of nociceptive pain, while also contributing to persistent models of pain in mice. 72</text>
<text><loc_262><loc_245><loc_468><loc_396>In men, we observed higher chromatin accessibility in transient receptor potential (TRP) channel-, NTRK1 , and Ca 2 1 -related genes in hDRG, with some of them being specifically more accessible in neurons. TRP channel genes play important roles in encoding neuronal responses to noxious thermal stimuli. Cumulative evidence indicates that the function of TRP channel genes is modulated differentially between sexes, partly due to the influence of sex hormones. 10 However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still to be uncovered, and our findings suggest a possible chromatin architecture explanation. In line with our results, NTRK1 is more abundant in men in the human tibial nerve. 63 At the level of transcriptional programs, AP-1 transcription factors were predominant in male hDRG in both bulk and spatial ATAC-seq specifically in neurons. These data are in close agreement with increased JUN and FOS-activated transcriptional cascades in DRGs from male patients with neuropathic pain in a thoracic vertebrectomy cohort. 64 We found that the promoters of genes such as OSMR or NLRP3 are predicted to be bound by these transcription factors. The abundance of binding sites for these genes in male open chromatin in the DRG correlates with the increased OSM signaling specifically upregulated in men in the thoracic vertebrectomy cohort. 55,64</text>
<text><loc_262><loc_398><loc_468><loc_479>Collectively, our data demonstrate distinct baseline sexspecific chromatin accessibility patterns and transcriptional programs in hDRG. Differences observed in female hDRG, such as increased accessibility of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and interferon-related genes, could contribute to their heightened susceptibility to pain, a hypothesis that can be tested in the future. Conversely, higher accessibility of TRP and NTRK1 genes in men might underlie distinct nociceptive pain mechanisms. These findings highlight fundamental sex differences in the epigenomic architecture of the human peripheral nervous system with implications for understanding sex differences in clinical pain disorders.</text>

<text><loc_32><loc_48><loc_238><loc_240>This study has multiple limitations. First, we did not assess differences in chromatin accessibility between pain and nonpain hDRG samples. Our future studies will analyze whether the chromatin features in genes from our current work participate in chronic pain. Second, we did not perform multiomics from the samecell, making it difficult to test for a direct correlation between gene expression and chromatin accessibility. We tried to partially address this issue by correlating RNA and accessible chromatin from the same DRGs; however, the correlation was low, probably due to the small sample size. Another explanation for the low correlation is that accessible regions are not necessarily associated with actively transcribed genes, or they are associated with genes that are poised to become active under specific conditions. 74 It can also be the case where the transcription factor needed to activate gene transcription of accessible genes may be lacking in a particular cell state, but turned on in another, such as after injury. Our work here can be viewed as an important starting point for understanding the epigenome of the hDRG. Further research combining spatial and single-cell assessment of different histone marks, other DNA modifications, and interactions with transcription factors will be required to fully understand the epigenomic landscape of human nociceptors and to get a better interpretation of gene regulation in this complex tissue. Finally, our data provide evidence of X inactivation escape in hDRG neurons of women, but this idea should be tested with experimental manipulations, potentially in cultured hDRG neurons, to better understand its functional consequences and mechanisms.</text>
