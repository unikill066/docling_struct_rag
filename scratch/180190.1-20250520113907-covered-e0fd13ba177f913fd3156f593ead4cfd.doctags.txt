<text><loc_64><loc_158><loc_442><loc_235>Spinal microglia play a pivotal role in the development of neuropathic pain. Peripheral nerve injury induces changes in the transcriptional profile of microglia, including increased expression of components of the translational machinery. Whether microglial protein synthesis is stimulated following nerve injury and has a functional role in mediating pain hypersensitivity is unknown. Here, we show that nascent protein synthesis is upregulated in spinal microglia following peripheral nerve injury in both male and female mice. Stimulating mRNA translation in microglia by selectively ablating the translational repressor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) promoted the transition of microglia to a reactive state and induced mechanical hypersensitivity in both sexes, whereas spontaneous pain was increased only in males. Conversely, inhibiting microglial translation by expressing a mutant form of 4E-BP1 in microglia attenuated their activation following peripheral nerve injury and alleviated neuropathic pain in both sexes. Thus, stimulating 4E-BP1-dependent translation promotes microglial reactivity and mechanical hypersensitivity, whereas inhibiting it alleviates neuropathic pain.</text>

<text><loc_36><loc_276><loc_248><loc_396>Peripheral nerve injury may lead to neuropathic pain, a prevalent and debilitating chronic pain condition. Nerve injury-induced proliferation and activation of microglia in the spinal cord is one of the key processes  mediating the development of neuropathic pain (1-4). Activated microglia promote pain hypersensitivity through various mechanisms, including  (i)  enhancement  of  excitatory  synaptic  transmission  via release of TNF , IL-1 β , IL-6, PGE 2 , and ATP (5-8); and (ii) reduction in inhibitory tone via suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission by proinflammatory cytokines (8, 9) and BDNF-mediated downregulation of K + -Cl cotransporter [KCC2] in neurons (10, 11), as well as via engulfment of inhibitory synapses (12, 13) and components of the extracellular matrix, such as perineuronal nets (14). The critical role of microglia in neuropathic pain is sexually dimorphic (15, 16). Whereas both sexes exhibit microglial proliferation and activation in response to peripheral nerve injury, the functional role of microglia in mediating neuropathic pain is predominantly observed in male animals (2, 17).</text>
<text><loc_36><loc_399><loc_248><loc_419><loc_259><loc_269><loc_471><loc_411>Stimulation of microglia in response to peripheral nerve injury is mediated via the release of proteases (18, 19) and bioactive molecules (2) from damaged or hyperactive sensory neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn. These molecules bind to and activate their corresponding  receptors  on  microglia  (e.g.,  CSF1-CSF1R,  ATPP2X4R/P2Y12R, and CX3CL1-CX3CR1) (3, 20-22), triggering the  downstream  activation  of  intracellular  signaling  pathways such as p38, ERK1/2, and AKT (23-28) and eliciting changes in gene expression. Numerous studies have focused on transcriptional changes in microglia as an important mechanism to modulate their functional state. These studies have also revealed that peripheral  nerve  injury  induces  transcriptional  upregulation  of  genes encoding for components of translational machinery, including the small and large ribosomal subunits and translational factors (29, 30). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that local mRNA translation is essential for efficient phagocytic activity in microglia, a process central to their ability to promote pain hypersensitivity  (31).  Despite  accumulating  evidence  of  increased  expression of translation machinery components following peripheral nerve injury, and the central role of local protein synthesis in microglial phagocytosis, the functional role of microglial protein synthesis in neuropathic pain remains unknown.</text>

<text><loc_31><loc_92><loc_243><loc_312>Nascent protein synthesis is increased in microglia after peripheral nerve injury .  We  first  investigated  whether  peripheral  nerve  injury induces an upregulation of protein synthesis in spinal microglia. To measure the rates of de novo protein synthesis in microglia, we employed fluorescent noncanonical amino acid tagging (FUNCAT) (32, 33). In FUNCAT, an azide-bearing methionine analog, l -azidohomoalanine  (AHA),  is  incorporated  into  a  newly synthesized polypeptide chain, followed by its labeling in spinal cord sections with click chemistry and detection using immunofluorescence (Figure 1A). Mice were kept on a methionine-deficient diet for 3 days prior to being subjected to the spared nerve injury (SNI) assay of neuropathic pain (34, 35). Four days after SNI, AHA was injected i.p. (Figure 1B), and spinal cord tissue was collected 3 hours later. Quantification of AHA signal in individual Iba1 +  microglia in the superficial dorsal horn (laminae I, II, and III; identified using a lamina overlay by NeuN staining) showed that 4 days after SNI, microglia in the ipsilateral dorsal horn  exhibited  an  increase  in  protein  synthesis  compared  with those  in  the  contralateral  side  in  both  male  and  female  mice (males in Figure 1C, females in Figure 1D; see also Supplemental  Figure  1A;  supplemental  material  available  online  with  this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI180190DS1). An assessment at  a  later  time  point,  14  days  after  SNI,  revealed  no  significant increase in microglial protein synthesis (Supplemental Figure 1B). The validity of the FUNCAT approach for detecting protein synthesis was confirmed using the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, which blocked AHA incorporation (Supplemental Figure 1C). Thus, protein synthesis was upregulated in spinal microglia on day 4 but not on day 14 after peripheral nerve injury.</text>
<text><loc_31><loc_315><loc_243><loc_473>Activating 4E-BP1-dependent translation in microglia induces mechanical hypersensitivity . To study the functional role of enhanced microglial protein synthesis in pain, we assessed the effect of increasing translation in microglia on pain thresholds. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of mRNA translation. mTORC1 stimulates translation predominantly by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), which repress translation by binding and inhibiting the activity of the mRNA 5 ′ cap-binding protein eIF4E (Figure 2A). Phosphorylation of 4E-BPs by  mTORC1  induces  their  dissociation  from  eIF4E,  promoting formation  of  an  eIF4F  complex  (composed  of  eIF4E,  eIF4A, and eIF4G), which stimulates cap-dependent translation (36, 37). Ablation of 4E-BPs mimics mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of  4E-BPs  and  is  commonly  used  to  stimulate  eIF4E-dependent translation downstream of mTORC1 (38, 39). There are 3 4E-BP isoforms (4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, and 4E-BP3; 4E-BP3 expression levels are very low in the central nervous system), which have similar functions but differ in tissue distribution (40). We previously showed that 4E-BP1 is the main isoform modulating nociception, as whole-body 4E-BP1-KO (but not 4E-BP2-KO) mice exhibited reduced mechanical pain thresholds (40).</text>
<text><loc_254><loc_39><loc_466><loc_174>To stimulate translation in microglia, we ablated 4E-BP1 selectively in microglia by crossing Eif4ebp1 fl/fl mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the microglia-specific Tmem119 promoter to generate Eif4ebp1 fl/fl :TMEM119 CreERT2 mice (referred to as 4E-BP1cKO; Figure 2B). To induce Cre-dependent ablation of 4E-BP1 in microglia, we injected 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) i.p. on P4-P9. IHC confirmed reduction of 4E-BP1 in Iba1 +  microglia in the spinal cord of 4E-BP1-cKO mice compared with control ( Eif4ebp1 fl/fl ) animals (Figure 2C). Behavioral analysis revealed that adult male and female 4E-BP1-cKO mice exhibited mechanical hypersensitivity in von Frey (Figure 2, D and F) and tail-clip (Figure 2, E and G) assays. Consistent with the previous report in whole-body 4E-BP1 knockouts,  thermal  sensitivity  was  not  altered  in  4E-BP1-cKO mice in the radiant heat paw-withdrawal (Figure 2, H and J) and hot-plate (Figure 2, I and K) assays. Assessment of spontaneous pain using the mouse grimace scale (MGS) revealed an increase in the MGS score in 4E-BP1-cKO male mice (Figure 2L) but not in females (Figure 2M).</text>
<text><loc_254><loc_177><loc_466><loc_312>Translational  upregulation  induces  morphological  changes  and enhanced phagocytosis in microglia .  We next studied the effect of enhancing protein synthesis in microglia on their number, morphology, and phagocytic capacity. 4E-BP1-cKO mice exhibited no  differences  in  microglial  density  in  the  lumbar  spinal  cord dorsal  horn  (Figure  3,  A  and  B).  Morphological  analysis  of microglia using 3D reconstruction of Iba1 staining revealed that 4E-BP1-deficient microglia exhibited smaller arbors, indicated by the decreased number of intersections across the arbor in 3D Sholl  analysis  (Figure  3,  C  and  D)  and  reduced  branch  number (Figure 3E) and length (Figure 3F). Quantification of lysosomal volume in microglia using volumetric analysis of CD68 signal demonstrated an increased volume of CD68 +  lysosomes in  Iba1 +   microglia  in  4E-BP1-cKO mice (Figure 3, C and G). The  reduced  arborization  and  increased  phagocytic  capacity observed in 4E-BP1-deficient microglia suggest that stimulation of  protein  synthesis  promoted the transition of microglia to a more reactive state (41).</text>
<text><loc_254><loc_315><loc_466><loc_427>4E-BP1 ablation induces changes in microglial translational landscape .  Ablation  of  4E-BP1  stimulates  translation  of  eIF4E-sensitive mRNAs, which are involved in immune responses, modulation of extracellular matrix, cell survival, and growth (42-45). To  better  understand  how  4E-BP1  ablation  affects  microglial functions and induces mechanical pain hypersensitivity, we studied  changes  in  the  translational  landscape  in  microglia  lacking 4E-BP1. To identify the actively translating mRNAs in microglia, we employed a translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) approach (46, 47). In the TRAP assay, the ribosomal subunit L10a tagged with eGFP (L10a-eGFP) is expressed in a specific cell type (Figure 4A). IP with eGFP antibody captures the eGFP-tagged ribosomes,  and  subsequent  sequencing  of  immunoprecipitated ribosome-bound mRNAs allows for the identification of actively translated mRNAs in the cell type of interest.</text>
<text><loc_254><loc_430><loc_466><loc_473>To this end, we generated control  (L10a-eGFP: TMEM119 CreERT2 ) and 4E-BP1-cKO ( Eif4ebp1 fl/fl :L10a-eGFP: TMEM119 CreERT2 )  mice  expressing  L10a-eGFP  in  microglia.  Imaging  of spinal cord sections confirmed that L10a-eGFP was expressed in Iba1 +   microglia (Figure 4B). We then performed IP for eGFP in spinal  cord  lysates  (3  biological  replicates  per  genotype,  3  mice</text>

A high correlation of sequencing reads between biological replicates ( r ≥ 0.97 for IN and for IP, Supplemental Figure 2, A-D) indicated reproducibility across  experiments.  The  enrichment  of  microglial  gene  markers (e.g., Tmem119 , Aif1 , Cx3cr1 , P2ry12 )  and  depletion  of  neuronal (e.g., Gad2 , Camk2a , Calca , Calcb )  and  other  nonneuronal  (e.g., Sox10 , Olig1 , Gfap , Mog , Mbp , Olig2 ) gene markers in immunoprecipitated mRNA populations (Figure 4C) demonstrated the specificity  of   the  approach.  Analysis  of  ribosome-bound  mRNAs  in microglia of 4E-BP1-cKO and control mice revealed an increase in ribosome occupancy for 135 genes and a decrease for 79 genes (Figure  4,  D-F;  a  complete  dataset  is  provided  in  Supplemental  Table  1).  Normalization of ribosome-bound mRNA reads to total transcript reads from IN fractions (IP/IN ratio, Supplemental  Figure 2, E and F) provided a proxy for translational changes.  Pathway  analysis  of  genes  with  altered  ribosome  occupancy in 4E-BP1-cKO mice showed changes in processes related to the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) pathway, extracellular matrix organization  (hyaluronic  acid  binding,  metalloexopeptidase  and hydrolase  activity,  serine-type  peptidase  activity),  and  cytokine receptors (Figure 4G), which are implicated in regulating microglial functions (48) and pathological pain (14, 49, 50). Additionally, several mRNAs encoding proteins involved in phagocytosis ( Itgb3 , AXL , Cd44 ,  and Cdc42 )  exhibited  increased  ribosome  binding  in 4E-BP1-KO  microglia  (Supplemental  Table  1).  In  response  to peripheral nerve injury, spinal microglia promote pain hypersensitivity  by  phagocytosing various cellular components, including inhibitory synapses (12, 13) and extracellular matrix components (14). At later stages, a subpopulation of CD11c +  microglia facilitates  pain  resolution  by  engulfing  myelin  debris  (e.g.,  myelin basic  protein  [MBP])  and  secreting  IGF1  (50,  51).  Assessment of microglial lysosomal content revealed an increased proportion of  microglia  containing  VGAT  (vesicular  GABA  transporter), a  marker  of  inhibitory  synapses,  and  WFA  ( Wisteria  floribunda agglutinin),  a  marker  of  the  extracellular  matrix  -  but  not  of MBP - within CD68 +  lysosomes of 4E-BP1-cKO mice (Supplemental Figure 3, A-C). scRNA-Seq of sorted microglia (gated for CD45 lo CD11B hi CX3CR1 hi )  did  not  reveal  substantial  changes  in the  proportions  of  cells  in  distinct  microglial  subpopulations  or the appearance of new microglial clusters in 4E-BP1-cKO mice (Supplemental Figure 4, A and B). In 4E-BP1-cKO mice, distinct microglial  clusters  (clusters  4  and  5)  showed  similarities  to  the transcriptional  signature  of  disease-associated  microglia  (DAM) and injury-responsive microglia (IRM) (52, 53), but not of CD11c + microglia (50) (Supplemental Figure 4, C-E). Administration of the IGF1-neutralizing antibody (50) did not alleviate mechanical hypersensitivity in 4E-BP1-cKO mice (Supplemental Figure 4F), suggesting that the increased pain hypersensitivity in these mice was not mediated through CD11c +  microglia/IGF1 signaling.</text>

We next studied whether inhibiting translation in microglia alleviates nerve injury-induced microglial reactivity  and  mechanical  pain  hypersensitivity.  To  selectively  inhibit translation in microglia, we used a transgenic mouse conditionally expressing 4E-BP1 with mutations in 2 key mTORC1 phosphorylation sites (threonine to alanine at amino acid positions 37 and 46; Tg-4EBP1mt )  (54).  Crossing Tg-4EBP1mt mice  to TMEM119 CreERT2 animals ( Tg-4EBP1mt:TMEM119 CreERT2 , referred to as 4E-BP1 cMT; Figure 5A) allows for the expression of mutated 4E-BP1 in microglia, resulting in the diminished effect of mTORC1 on eIF4E-dependent translation in microglia (54).</text>

<text><loc_36><loc_376><loc_248><loc_426>In this work, we found that peripheral nerve injury enhanced protein synthesis in spinal microglia. Furthermore, we demonstrated the functional role of increased protein synthesis, as upregulating 4E-BP1-dependent translation in microglia induced the transition of microglia to a reactive state and promoted pain hypersensitivity, whereas translational downregulation attenuated nerve injuryinduced microglia activation and pain.</text>

Translational regulation allows for rapid and local modulation of protein levels in response to internal and external cues (55). The central  role  of  local  translation  in  mediating  efficient  microglial phagocytosis has recently been demonstrated (31). This work, along with other studies (56-60), underscore the importance of translational  control  in  microglia  in  regulating  key  phenotypes and functions.  Our  findings  bolster  this  conclusion  by  showing that  stimulation  of  4E-BP1-dependent  translation  in  microglia was  sufficient  to  induce  phenotypes  associated  with  microglial activation  (reduced  arborization  and  increased  lysosome  volume), and inhibition of translation attenuated the transition of microglia from a resting to a reactive state. These findings have substantial implications for understanding the mechanisms modulating  microglial  activity  in  the  context  of  neuropathic  pain. They may also be relevant for other conditions where mTORC1 activity  is  enhanced,  such  as  germline  or  somatic  mutations  in PTEN , TSC1/2 , PIK3CA , AKT3 , RHEB , and MTOR (61-68). Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of the intricate mechanisms that promote microglial reactivity and their roles in regulating neuronal circuits and brain functions.</text>

<text><loc_31><loc_391><loc_243><loc_473>The increase in microglial protein synthesis was detected on day 4 after nerve injury but not on day 14. Moreover, downregulating  4E-BP1-dependent  translation  before  peripheral  nerve injury, but not at later stages (injection of tamoxifen on days 4-9 after SNI in 4E-BP1 cMT mice), alleviated pain hypersensitivity. These results indicate that the nerve injury-induced enhancement of microglial protein synthesis was involved in the development, but not maintenance, phase of neuropathic pain. They also suggest that the demonstrated role of microglia in neuropathic pain maintenance  (69,  70)  is  not  mediated  via  a  4E-BP1-dependent translational control mechanism.</text>
<text><loc_254><loc_391><loc_466><loc_473>Microglia can promote development of pain hypersensitivity via  numerous  mechanisms,  including  release  of  bioactive  molecules (e.g., cytokines and chemokines) and phagocytosis of synaptic  elements and components of the extracellular matrix. The microglial  TRAP analysis identified increased ribosome binding of  several  mRNAs  encoding  proteins  involved  in  phagocytosis, such as Itgb3 , AXL , Cd44 , and Cdc42 , in 4E-BP1-cKO mice. Furthermore, 4E-BP1-cKO mice had more microglia containing lysosomal VGAT (a marker of inhibitory presynaptic terminals preferentially engulfed by microglia in SNI) (12) and WFA (a marker of extracellular matrix engulfed by microglia in SNI) (14), raising</text>

Distinct microglia subpopulations may have pronociceptive or antinociceptive functions. CD11c +  antinociceptive microglia promote the resolution of neuropathic pain via IGF1-dependent mechanism (50). Because  the  quantity  of  CD11c +   microglia  is  very  low  in  naive animals,  a  further  decrease  in  their  abundance  in  4E-BP1-cKO mice is unlikely. Accordingly, in 4E-BP1-cKO mice, we did not find  microglia  harboring  a  CD11c-like  transcriptome,  and  IGF1</text>

<text><loc_36><loc_39><loc_248><loc_159>specificity in 4E-BP1-cKO mice is related to the effect of 4E-BP1. 4E-BP1 regulates translation of a subset of mRNAs that are eIF4E sensitive (42-45). These mRNAs have a long and highly structured 5 ′ UTR that  requires  the  eIF4F  complex  and  its  eIF4A  helicase activity to unwind mRNA secondary structures to promote translation. Using TRAP, we identified transcripts showing altered ribosome occupancy in 4E-BP1-deficient microglia. Pathway analysis of the identified transcripts revealed changes in the IGF-1, extracellular matrix organization, and cytokine receptor pathways, which are  involved  in  regulation  of  microglia  functions  and  pain  (14, 48-50). Additionally, several transcripts encoding proteins involved in  phagocytosis  ( Itgb3 , Axl , Cd44 ,  and Cdc42 )  showed  increased ribosome binding in the TRAP analysis of 4E-BP1-KO microglia, potentially  linking  4E-BP-dependent  translation  and  enhanced phagocytosis. Why altered translation of these transcripts promotes mechanical but not thermal hypersensitivity remains unknown.</text>
<text><loc_36><loc_161><loc_248><loc_304>We  found  that  increasing  translation  in  microglia  (using 4E-BP1 cKO) was sufficient to induce mechanical hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. It also induced spontaneous pain, as assessed using the MGS; however, this phenotype was observed in males only. Inhibiting translation in microglia alleviated nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity in both sexes. Although many studies have demonstrated that microglia are required for the development of neuropathic  pain  exclusively  in  males  (15),  emerging evidence suggests that not all microglial functions in pain are sexually dimorphic and that the mode and timing of microglial modulation or inhibition, as well as the pain model employed, dictate the role of microglia in females (72-74). Induction of spontaneous pain in male but not female mice with increased microglial translation indicates sexual dimorphism in this behavior. The mechanisms and signaling pathways stimulating translation in spinal microglia following peripheral nerve injury remain unknown. Activation of microglial  MAPKs,  such  as  p38  and  ERK,  or  mTORC1,  which play a central role in neuropathic pain and promote translation by modulating eIF4E activity (23-28, 75, 76), might be involved.</text>
<text><loc_36><loc_307><loc_248><loc_342>Notably, peripheral nerve injury also enhances protein synthesis in distinct neuronal cell types in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord,  predominantly  in  inhibitory  neurons,  which  exhibit  more prominent translational upregulation in the chronic phases of neuropathic pain (77).</text>
<text><loc_36><loc_345><loc_248><loc_381>In summary, the demonstration of translational upregulation in microglia following peripheral nerve injury and its contribution to  the  development  of  mechanical  hypersensitivity  enhance  our understanding of basic microglial biology and the mechanisms by which microglia promote pathological pain.</text>

Following habituation, the mice were recorded for 1 hour using a Sony Digital Camcorder HDR-PJ430V. One frame was selected from each 3-minute interval, resulting in a total of 20 images per mouse. The images were then randomized, and the coder, masked to the experimental groups, analyzed them to calculate each mouse's mean score. Scoring was based on 5 facial features (action units): orbital tightening, nose bulge, cheek bulge, ear position, and whisker changes. Each action unit was scored on a scale from 0 to 2, where 0 indicated no evidence of the action unit, 1 indicated moderate evidence, and 2 indicated obvious evidence. The final MGS score for each mouse was obtained by averaging the intensity ratings of all 5 features.</text>

<text><loc_36><loc_154><loc_248><loc_427>TRAP-Seq was performed as previously described (46, 47). The lumbar part of the spinal cord was extracted and transferred to ice-cold dissection buffer (1 × HBSS, 2.5 mM HEPES-NaOH [pH 7.4], 35 mM glucose,  5  mM  MgCl 2 ;  100 μ g/mL cycloheximide  and  0.2  mg/mL emetine were added just before use). Spinal cords were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH [pH 7.4], 12 mM MgCl 2 ,  and 150 mM KCl in RNAse-free water; 0.5 mM DTT, 1 μ l/mL Protease Inhibitor  Cocktail  [Roche],  100 μ g/mL  cycloheximide,  20 μ g/mL emetine, 40 U/mL RNasin [Promega], and 2 U/mL TURBO DNase [Invitrogen] were added immediately before use) using a glass pestle. The homogenate was then transferred to tubes and further homogenized using a Minilys Personal High Power Tissue Homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) on medium speed for 10 seconds a total of 8 times at 4ºC. Postnuclear samples were collected by centrifuging at 2,000 g for  5  minutes  at  4ºC  and  collection  of  the  supernatant.  NP-40  (AG Scientific) and DHPC (Avanti Polar Lipids) were added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 1% and left to incubate for 5 minutes. A postmitochondrial fraction was obtained by centrifuging samples at 15,000 g for 10 minutes. An aliquot of 200 μ L was taken and used for the IN sample, and the rest of the fraction was incubated in G-coated Dynabeads (10003D, Invitrogen) bound to 50 μ g  anti-GFP antibodies (HtzGFP-19F7 and HtzGFP-19C8 antibodies were acquired from Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Center)  on  an  end-over-end  mixer  overnight.  The  next  day,  the  beads  were  washed  with  a  high-salt  buffer (containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH [pH 7.4], 12 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.35 M KCl, 1% NP-40 [AG Scientific] in RNAse-free water; 100 μ g/mL cycloheximide and 0.5 mM DTT were added just before use) to collect the IP fraction. RNA was then extracted by incubating the samples in TRIzol (300 μ L IP; 600 μ L IN) at room temperature for 10 minutes. IP samples were then vortexed and placed on a magnetic stand to remove the extracted RNA from the beads. Equal parts of 100% ethanol were added to each sample (300 μ L IP, 800 μ L IN). RNA was eluted using a Direct-zol RNA kit (Zymo Research) using the manufacturer's protocol. The NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies) was used to quantify RNA yield, and the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) was used to assess RNA quality.</text>

<text><loc_31><loc_39><loc_243><loc_159>expressed genes were determined between sham-treated and SNI of the same cell type and time point by calculating the Bhattacharyya distance (86). This measure is used to calculate the amount of overlap in the AUC of the 2 sample distributions (corresponding to each group). BD compares distribution of gene relative to abundance (in TPM). The Bhattacharyya coefficient [BC(Q)i] ranges between 0 (for totally nonoverlapping distributions) and 1 (for completely identical distributions) and is derived from the Bhattacharyya distance. In our analysis, we used a modified form of the Bhattacharyya coefficient that ranges between 0 (for completely identical distributions) and +1 or -1 (for totally nonoverlapping distributions; sign defined by the logFC value). DE genes were identified if the absolute value of SSMD was greater than or equal to 0.9, the absolute value of BC was greater than or equal to 0.5, and FC was greater than or equal to 1.33. Coding for bioinformatics analysis and data visualization was performed in Python (version 3.7 with Anaconda distribution).</text>

Spinal cords were dissected and placed in a well plate containing 3 mL DMEM with 2  mg/mL collagenase type IV (Gibco). The tissue was minced with scissors and treated with 1 μ L DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 minutes at 37°C.</text>

The  cell  suspensions  were then  passed  through  a  70 μ m prewetted (with DMEM) cell strainer, transferred to a prechilled 50 mL tube, and centrifuged at 22°C for 10 minutes (400 g , acceleration: 2, brake: 1).</text>
<text><loc_31><loc_307><loc_243><loc_358>The supernatant was decanted, and the cell pellet was washed with 15-20 mL of 1 × HBSS, followed by centrifugation under the same conditions.

<text><loc_254><loc_85><loc_466><loc_273>Droplet libraries were processed using Cell Ranger count pipeline (89). Sequencing reads were aligned to the mm10 mouse reference genome, and transcript counts were quantified for each annotated gene within every cell. Count matrices (genes × cells) were loaded into the R package  Seurat  (90)  for  quality  control  and  downstream  analyses. Low-quality  cells  were  filtered  out  using  the  following  criteria:  (a) the number of detected genes ≤300; (b) percentage of mitochondrial RNA ≥5% per cell. Cell doublets were detected and removed using the R package scDblFinder (91). After filtering, we had 1,014 cells in the  WT group and 386 cells in the 4E-BP1-cKO group. Following SCTransform normalization, individual samples were integrated using the RPCAIntegration procedure. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimension reduction was generated based on the first  20  principal  components.  A  nearest-neighbor  graph  using  the first 20 principal components was calculated using the FindNeighbors function, followed by clustering using the FindClusters function with resolution = 1.4. Cluster-specific marker genes were identified using the function FindMarkers with the following cutoffs: log 2 FC > 0.5 and adjusted P <  0.05  (upregulated  genes  only).  Per-cluster  differential expression testing between the 2 samples was conducted using a single-cell approach with FindMarkers . To test for signature enrichment in clusters, we first used the AddModuleScore function to calculate the normalized average expression of each marker set in single cells and then performed Wilcoxon's test to compare the values in cells from designated clusters to all remaining cells.</text>
