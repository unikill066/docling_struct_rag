## Abstract 35

|   36 | Neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) receive and transmit sensory information from the     |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   37 | tissues they innervate and from the external environment. Upper cervical (C1-C2) DRGs are       |
|   38 | functionally unique as they receive input from the neck, head, and occipital cranial dura, the  |
|   39 | latter two of which are also innervated by the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The C2 DRG also plays  |
|   40 | an important role in neck pain, a common and disabling disorder that is poorly understood.      |
|   41 | Advanced transcriptomic approaches have significantly improved our ability to characterize RNA  |
|   42 | expression patterns at single-cell resolution in the DRG and TG, but no previous studies have   |
|   43 | characterized the C2 DRG. Our aim was to use single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic          |
|   44 | approaches to create a molecular map of C2 DRGs from patients undergoing arthrodesis            |
|   45 | surgery with ganglionectomy. Patients with acute (<3 months) or chronic ( ≥ 3 months) neck pain |
|   46 | were enrolled and completed patient-reported outcomes and quantitative sensory testing prior to |
|   47 | surgery. C2 DRGs were characterized with bulk, single nucleus, and spatial RNA sequencing       |
|   48 | technologies from 22 patients. Through a comparative analysis to published datasets of the      |
|   49 | lumbar DRG and TG, neuronal clusters identified in both TG and DRG were identified in the C2    |
|   50 | DRG. Therefore, our study definitively characterizes the molecular composition of human C2      |
|   51 | neurons and establishes their similarity with unique characteristics of subsets of TG neurons.  |
|   52 | We identified differentially expressed genes in endothelial, fibroblast and myelinating Schwann |
|   53 | cells associated with chronic pain, including FGFBP2, C8orf34 and EFNA1 which have been         |
|   54 | identified in previous genome and transcriptome wide association studies (GWAS/TWAS). Our       |
|   55 | work establishes an atlas of the human C2 DRG and identifies altered gene expression patterns   |
|   56 | associated with chronic neck pain. This work establishes a foundation for the exploration of    |
|   57 | painful disorders in humans affecting the cervical spine.                                       |

## Introduction 59

Since the introduction of single cell and spatial sequencing technologies, a major goal of 60 the somatosensation and pain neuroscience fields has been to characterize dorsal root ganglion 61 (DRG) and trigeminal ganglion (TG) cells with molecular precision (Renthal et al., 2021). Great 62 progress has been made in this area using rodent DRG and TG neurons where we now have 63 comprehensive cell censuses from development to adulthood and including many chronic pain 64 models (Usoskin et al., 2015; Zeisel et al., 2018; Renthal et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). 65 Similar progress has been made in characterizing the human DRG and TG where we also now 66 have spatial and single cell sequencing datasets that demonstrate that there are between 12 67 and 18 subtypes of sensory neurons in the adult human, lumbar DRG (Nguyen et al., 2021; 68 Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022; Jung et al., 2023; Bhuiyan et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024). Subtypes 69 of human TG neurons have also been characterized (Yang et al., 2022), although to a lesser 70 extent than the progress that has been made on lumbar DRGs. These studies have revealed full 71 transcriptomes of neuronal cell types in multiple species and a harmonized atlas across species 72 has recently been built (Bhuiyan et al., 2024). Important species differences have also been 73 found. One major difference between humans and rodents is the more expansive expression of 74 the capsaicin and noxious heat receptor TRPV1 in human DRG neurons (Shiers et al., 2020; 75 Shiers et al., 2021; Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022). Another is the lack of a clear distinction 76 between peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors in human DRG (Shiers et al., 2020; Shiers 77 et al., 2021) and the identification of unique subsets of human DRG neurons (Tavares-Ferreira 78 et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2024). 79

A key gap in knowledge is a lack of information about DRGs at the cervical level in 80 humans. These DRGs, at the C1 and C2 level, are functionally and anatomically interesting 81 because they innervate structures like skin, muscle and bone, but also the occipital portion of 82 the cranial meninges (Keller et al., 1985; Noseda et al., 2019). The rest of the cranial meninges 83 is innervated by the TG from the V1 subdivision of that ganglia. Presumably, DRG neurons in 84 the C2 DRG would share characteristics of both DRG and TG neurons, but this hypothesis has 85 never been addressed in humans. Another important gap in knowledge pertains to a common 86 and disabling painful disorder - chronic neck pain. Neck pain is an important cause of disability 87 world-wide; existing treatments are sparse and mostly lack an evidence base for their clinical 88 use (Safiri et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2024). The C2 DRG innervates the atlantoaxial joint, a known 89 originator of neck pain in osteoarthritis, and structures of the cervical spine that can be acutely 90 injured after a fall. In addition, changes to the C2 DRG may be a source of pain. During C1-2 91 fusion surgeries, this DRG can be resected as part of clinical care. 92

The work described here had two primary goals. The first was to characterize the 93 transcriptome of cells in the human C2 DRG using single cell and spatial transcriptomic 94 techniques with the purpose of addressing how neurons in these ganglia relate to previous 95 findings in lumbar DRG and TG of humans. The second goal was to ascertain whether the 96 transcriptomes of these cells were altered in samples from people who suffer from chronic neck 97 pain, compared to those with acute pain. This would address the lack of understanding of the 98 transcriptional mechanisms underlying chronic neck pain, potentially identifying novel molecular 99 targets to treat this burdensome condition. 100

Here we describe the first analysis of the human C2 DRG at single cell resolution. Our 101 work demonstrates that there are similarities to both the lumbar DRG and TG in the human C2 102 DRG, consistent with its unique anatomical innervation pattern. The removal of these DRGs 103

during C1-2 fusion surgeries, performed to treat either an acute cervical spine injury or chronic 104 neck pain, provided an opportunity to examine changes in gene expression that might be linked 105 to chronic neck pain. We found several endothelial, fibroblast and Schwann cell-related genes 106 that were associated with chronic neck pain, and relatively few changes in neuronal 107 transcriptomes. Altogether, our findings enhance our knowledge of the molecular makeup of 108 human DRGs, expanding our understanding to the cervical level, and give insight into potential 109 mechanisms of chronic neck pain. 110

## Results 111

## Characterization of the human C2 DRG with single nucleus sequencing 112

We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the molecular 113 composition of the C2 DRG. DRGs from 12 patients were included in this analysis, 7 DRGs from 114 patients with acute injury and 5 DRGs from patients with chronic pain. Nuclei were isolated from 115 hDRGs and fixed and barcoded   using the 10X flex kit to facilitate single-nucleus resolution 116 RNA expression data. We imposed cutoffs of 500 genes and 7.5% mitochondrial-RNA (mtRNA) 117 and obtained a minimum of 129 nuclei per sample. Two rounds of sequencing were performed 118 with more nuclei obtained per sample in the initial run, therefore the RunHarmony tool from the 119 Seurat package was used to merge and integrate the data. Using the FindClusters tool of the 120 Seurat package, we identified 18 unique cell clusters (Fig 1A-B). Expression of neuronal 121 ( SNAP25/PRPH ) and non-neuronal ( MPZ/COL1A1/FABP7 ) marker genes correlated with 122 distinct groupings in the UMAP (Fig 1C-D). Representation from all samples was confirmed in 123 all neuronal clusters, however, the non-neuronal cells were largely collected in one run as 124 observed in Figure 1B. We suggest the variability in cell subtype recovery was due to technical 125 variation in the dissociation process. The data was subset into neuronal and neuronal groups, to 126 characterize subclusters in greater detail. 127

Fourteen non-neuronal cell clusters were identified as seen in Figure 1E. Marker gene expression suggested several of these clusters were of the same non-neuronal cell type (Fig 1F). Expression of COL1A1, PODN and DCN was distinct in clusters 0, 3, 6, 7, and 11, indicating fibroblast populations. Clusters 4 and 13 exhibited expression of CD14 and CD163 indicating immune cell subtypes. Clusters 9 and 10 were identified as Schwann cells based on MLIP and PRX expression. Clusters 1, 5 and 8 showed variable but distinct expression of NCAM1 and FABP7 . Cluster 5 was unique in expressing SERPINA5 and could be distinguished as a satellite glial cell (SGC) population, while the lack of SERPINA5 allowed the labeling of clusters 1 and 8 as non-myelinating Schwann cells. Cluster 2 and cluster 12 both showed unique distinct expression of VWF/EGFL7 and NOTCH3/MYH11 indicating endothelial and mural cell populations, respectively.

indicating putative silent nociceptor populations. Other marker genes, including

sought to use additional approaches to characterize the neuronal subtypes in greater detail.

## Comparison of C2 DRG neurons to thoracic and lumbar DRG and TG populations 147

To characterize the neuronal clusters of the C2 DRG, we utilized previously published 148 labeling of human DRG, as well as trigeminal ganglia (TG) (Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022; 149 Bhuiyan et al., 2024). Using CONOS (Barkas et al., 2019), we transferred labels from neurons 150 characterized in lumbar DRGs onto the C2 DRG data (Fig 2A). The UMAP, which shows a 151 spatial representation of transcriptional similarity between nuclei, showed the groupings 152 identified in C2 DRGs correlating with labels from lumbar DRGs. In Figure 1B, violin plots 153 showed the proportions of clusters from lumbar DRGs identified in each of the C2 clusters. 154 Cluster 1 contained A-beta LTMR and A-delta LTMR neurons. Cluster 2 contained primarily 155 TRPA1+ nociceptors, as well as minor proportions of PENK+ and cold nociceptors. Cluster 10 156 was unique in distinctly correlating with the labeling of putative silent nociceptors. Interestingly, 157 cluster 7 was found to contain transcriptional similarity to all neuronal subtypes identified in 158 lumbar DRG, while exhibiting a very low number of enriched genes, indicating high 159 transcriptional heterogeneity in the cluster. Enriched expression of PKD1 and PDIA2 , two genes 160 that have previously been associated with injured neurons in the study of Parkinson's disease, 161 was observed in cluster 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 which surrounded cluster 7 in Figure 1H (Conn et al., 162 2004; Amadesi et al., 2009; Asaithambi et al., 2011). The probability of transcriptional similarity 163 between clusters 4, 7, 8 and 9 is high, based on the proximal location of nuclei in the UMAP. In 164 fact, the UMAP in Figure 2A with label transfer revealed the clusters in the lower right quadrant 165 appeared to include smaller subsets of all neuronal subtypes, and these clusters all, apart from 166 7, showed PKD1 and PDIA2 enrichment (Supplementary table 1A). Importantly, the source 167 material for this study was patient surgeries, specifically patients receiving surgery for either 168 acute traumatic injury or chronic ongoing degeneration of the joint. Consequently, injured 169 neurons may have originated from the ongoing disease state whether it was chronic neck pain 170 with arthritis or acute neck injury requiring C1-2 fusion. Interestingly, these genes are detected 171 in previous studies of hDRG but are lowly expressed in mouse (Jung et al., 2023; Bhuiyan et al., 172 2024), and are not known to be changes by injury in the mouse DRG (Renthal et al., 2020), 173 suggesting that these genes could be markers of neuronal injury in C2 hDRG. 174

We additionally used DRG and TG neuron labels characterized using single-nuc 175 RNAseq in the harmonized atlas by Bhuiyan et al. to assess the similarity to C2 DRG neurons to 176 lumbar and thoracic DRG neurons and TG neurons (Fig 2C-E). PVALB+ and DCN+ neuronal 177 populations labeled in lumbar and thoracic DRGs were observed in clusters 5, 7 and 9 in C2 178 DRGs (Fig 2C-D). ASIC1 was enriched in clusters 5 and 9 indicating non-nociceptive neurons. 179 Neuronal populations identified in TG defined by Mrgpra3+ (orthologous to human MRGPRX 180 genes) were observed in C2 DRGs, in clusters 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10 (Fig 2E). Additionally, 181 MRGPRX1 was found to be enriched in clusters 3 and 8 (Fig 2F). MRGPRX1+ neurons were 182 exclusively identified in TG in human samples in the harmonized atlas (Bhuiyan et al., 2024), 183 however, it was hypothesized that they were a rare cell type in the DRG (Yu et al., 2024). The 184 enrichment of MRGPRX1 + neurons may indicate a higher proportion of this cell-type in cervical 185 DRGs, similar to TG (Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022; Bhuiyan et al., 2024). TRPM8 , which has 186 previously been shown to be enriched in TG compared to DRG in rodents (Kobayashi et al., 187 2005), was lowly expressed in C2 DRG, and not enriched in any cluster. CALCA , while being 188 expressed in both DRG and TG, has been described as highly expressed in TG and 189 characterized as playing a role in migraine (Goadsby et al., 1990; Ohlsson et al., 2018). CALCA 190 was identified as enriched in 4 neuronal clusters (0, 2, 4, 10), correlating with nociceptive 191 clusters. 192

In mice, characterization of TG in comparison to DRG has revealed distinct 193 transcriptomic patterns. In a study by Megat et al., 381 DEGs were identified as highly enriched 194 in TG. When comparing the genes identified as enriched in TG and DRG in mice and 195 overlapping with enriched genes in each of the C2 clusters, clusters 0, 1, 5, 8 and 9 all had a 196 higher number of enriched genes in the TG (Supplementary table 1B). Fth1 and Pak1 were 197 identified as highly enriched in TG. Both of these genes have human orthologues, FTH1 and 198 PAK1 (Megat et al., 2019a). PAK1 was observed to be enriched in clusters 1 and 5 (A-fiber 199 LTMRs and proprioceptors when labeled according to DRG nomenclature) (Fig 2G). FTH1 was 200 expressed in multiple clusters and not enriched in one specific cluster (Fig 2H). Interestingly, in 201 human lumbar DRGs characterized with spatial sequencing, FTH1 was observed as broadly 202 expressed in all neuron populations, while PAK1 was very lowly expressed (Tavares-Ferreira et 203 al., 2022), indicating both species and DRG-level differences in the C2 DRG. 204

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections of 4 C2 DRGs were used to measure the average neuronal cell size (Fig 2I). The range of diameter of 407 neurons was 30 to 100 µm. This range falls in between the size-ranges reported for neurons in the lumbar DRGs in humans (30-125 µm) (Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022) and trigeminal neurons (30-80 µm) (Shiers et al., 2023). The mean neuron diameter of C2 DRG neurons was 64 µm, which aligned closely to the lumbar DRG mean of 67 µm, while TG neurons were 41 µm.

In summary, we observed that the neuronal cells in C2 DRGs exhibit similarities to both lumbar DRGs and TG. All neuronal subclusters characterized in lumbar DRGs were identified in C2 DRG, however, physical characterization of C2 DRGs reflected a reduction in size range compared to lumbar DRGs. This finding correlated with the clusters shown to exhibit transcriptional similarities to TGs: Clusters 0, 1 and 5, labeled as A-fiber LTMRs with label transfer and consequently most closely aligned transcriptionally to larger neurons. These A-fiber LTMR clusters also exhibited enrichment of genes characterizing the TG, including PAK1. Additionally, clusters 3 and 8, identified as likely pruritogen receptor enriched neurons, are enriched for MRGPRX1 , a gene showing robust expression in TG and minimal expression in lumbar DRGs.

## Transcriptomic differences between C2 DRGs recovered for acute injury or chronic pain 221 reflect results from transcriptomic/genomic wide association studies 222

The cervical DRGs were recovered during surgery from patients suffering either acute 223 trauma or long-term osteoarthritis of the joint associated with chronic pain. Based on 224 quantitative sensory testing (QST) and analysis of self-reported pain scores from patients prior 225 to surgery, it is apparent that the chronic pain experience in most of these patients does not 226 match characteristics that would classify the pain of these individuals as having neuropathic 227 pain (Table 1 and 2). Most individuals did not demonstrate signs of mechanical allodynia, and 228 only a small number of patients in the chronic pain group showed signs of cold hypersensitivity. 229 The major difference in terms of QST and pain report measures was the duration of pain, which 230 was much greater in the chronic pain group. This provided a unique opportunity to assess the 231 molecular differences driving chronic neck pain, in a well-characterized subgroup of patients. 232 We analyzed neuronal clusters and non-neuronal clusters, the latter of which were 233 amalgamated into 7 distinct clusters based on marker gene enrichment as described above 234 (Supplementary table 1C), to identify transcriptomic differences in these cell types associated 235 with chronic pain (Fig 3A-B). Differential gene expression was measured with DESeq2 and 236 defined as genes with adj. p-value &lt; 0.05 and |Log2FC| &gt; 0.5. 237

No differential genes were identified in any neuronal cluster; however, differential 238 expression patterns were discovered in endothelial, fibroblast and myelinating Schwann cells 239 (Fig 3C-E). In the endothelial cluster, 121 genes were identified, 114 of which were upregulated 240 in samples with chronic pain (Fig 3C, Supplementary table 2A). Upregulated genes included 241 C8orf34 , ICOS , CD2, FKBP5, and CXCL2 . C8orf34 has previously been associated with chronic 242 back pain in multiple GWAS (Freidin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023; Belonogova et al., 2025). 243 Upregulation of CXCL2, a pro-inflammatory chemokine ligand, has been associated with 244 neuropathic pain and orofacial trigeminal pain (Iwasa et al., 2019; Solis-Castro et al., 2021; 245 Hummig et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2023). Blockage of FKBP5 , FK506-binding protein 5, has 246 previously been shown to relieve inflammatory pain states in mice (Maiarø et al., 2018). CD2 is 247 an adhesion molecule usually observed on the surface of T-cells, and associated with an 248 inflammatory state driven by active T-cells. In contrast, ICOS has been suggested to alleviate 249 mechanical hypersensitivity induced by paclitaxel through T-cell activation (Sankaranarayanan 250 et al., 2023a). T-cell activity has previously been attributed to both pro- and anti-nociceptive 251 roles depending on the pathway of activation (Ji et al., 2016). Pathway analysis of the DEGs 252 showed enriched Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation as well as IL-17 signaling, implicating 253 endothelial cells in inflammation in chronic pain through interactions with immune cells. 254

Twenty-five genes were found to be upregulated in fibroblast cells (Fig 3D, Supplementary table 2B). C8orf34 , FGFBP2 and CCN3 were among upregulated genes. C8orf34 does not have a known function, but was also upregulated in endothelial cells suggesting that it may play a generalized role in non-neuronal cells in arthritic neck pain. FGFBP2 , which encodes fibroblast growth factor binding protein 2, has been associated with Modic changes in intervertebral disc degeneration and has been implicated as a possible blood biomarker of chronic neuropathic pain (Cherif et al., 2022; Islam et al., 2022; Rajasekaran et al., 2022). CCN3 was identified as the most highly enriched gene in fibroblasts, and this gene has been identified as playing a key role in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis through inflammatory fibroblasts (Tokuhiro et al., 2024).

In myelinating Schwann cells, 55 genes were found to be differentially expressed, 33 of which were upregulated in chronic pain (Fig 3E, Supplementary table 2C). FGFBP2 was upregulated in both fibroblasts and myelinating Schwann cells, again suggesting a generalized role for this gene in arthritic neck pain. FKBP1 , involved in the stress response and inflammatory pain was upregulated in both Schwann cells and endothelial cells (Maiarø et al., 2018). Furthermore, MKNK2 , which encodes the mitogen activated protein kinase interacting kinase (MNK) 2, was upregulated. MNK2, is a key mediator of inflammation through translation mediation, and has previously been associated with inflammatory dysregulation driving pain (Moy et al., 2017; Moy et al., 2018). METRN and NRG1 were also identified as differentially expressed. METRN, which encodes a secreted protein without a known receptor, was upregulated in chronic pain. Interestingly, previous research suggests a role for METRN in resolving neuropathic pain (Jłrgensen et al., 2012; Sankaranarayanan et al., 2025). NRG1 , which encodes neuregulin-1, was upregulated in acute pain. Neuregulin-1 is ascribed a neuroprotective role through immunoregulation driven by the NF-kB pathway (Simmons et al., 2016), however, it has also been indicated to drive neuropathic pain states through phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Calvo et al., 2011; Dai et al., 2014).

In summary, snRNAseq of C2 DRGs showed the primary transcriptional difference was 281 manifesting in non-neuronal cells. The differentially expressed genes in the endothelial cells, 282

fibroblasts and Schwann cells reflect abnormal transcriptional patterns indicating activation of 283 inflammatory pathways. Simultaneously, multiple transcripts, including METRN in Schwann cells 284 and ICOS in the endothelial cluster, indicate activation of neuroprotective mechanisms 285 potentially preventing the development of a neuropathic pain state. To assess whether the 286 transcriptional patterns reflected changes to the physical architecture of the DRG we used 287 additional RNA sequencing approaches. 288

Bulk RNAseq was carried out on 17 DRGs from 13 patients to assess transcriptomic changes in the whole C2 DRG when comparing acute and chronic pain. Fourty DEGs were identified, 17 of which were upregulated and 23 downregulated in chronic pain (Fig 4A, Supplementary table 3A). One gene correlated with findings from snRNAseq, specifically decreased expression of SLCO2A1 , a transporter of prostaglandin (Fig 4B). The transporter plays a role in clearing prostaglandin E2, PGE2, a key mediator of inflammatory pain (Davies et al., 1984; Nakanishi et al., 2021). Additionally, SLCO2A1 mutations are causative of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, a disease characterized by inflammation in bones and joints (Lu et al., 2023). Decreased expression of the PGE2 transporter suggests a disruption in PGE2 metabolism, with the upregulation of PGE2 in the C2 DRG contributing to inflammatory dysregulation. Consequently, multiple transcriptional changes are observed in the C2 DRG with bulk RNAseq and snRNAseq which reflect inflammatory pathways that may contribute to abnormal pain signaling. Several genes are observed in more than one cell-type with snRNAseq or in multiple sequencing approaches (Fig 4B-C). To assess the spatial organization of these changes in gene expression, we employed spatial RNAseq.

We obtained spatial transcriptomic data from 13 C2 DRGs from 8 patients. Sections of 306 DRG were sectioned onto Visium slides with 55 µm barcoded spots and imaged following H&amp;E 307 staining to obtain spatial information. Unique barcodes corresponding to spatial location were 308 bound to mRNA in each section to obtain spatially correlated transcriptomic data. We visually 309 confirmed barcodes that overlapped neurons and defined barcodes as (1) neuronal, (2) 310 immediately surrounding a neuron (surrounding), and (3) others, as defined previously (Tavares311 Ferreira et al., 2022). No differentially expressed genes were identified when comparing 312 samples from acute and chronic patients in any group of barcodes. This may be due to 313 insufficient sample size to find differences using this technique. However, the Visium data 314 allowed for a spatial characterization of the DEGs from bulk- and snRNAseq. The expression of 315 SNAP25 was primarily observed in neuronal barcodes, validating the barcode groups (Fig 4D). 316 SNAP25 consequently visualizes the neurons in samples 26 (chronic pain) and 27 (acute pain) 317 in Figure 4E-F. Subsequently, we evaluated the spatial expression patterns of FGFBP2 , METRN 318 and SLCO2A1 . FGFBP2 was upregulated in chronic pain in myelinating Schwann cells and 319 fibroblast cells, while METRN was upregulated in Schwann cells. Using the spatial 320 transcriptomics data, FGFBP2 and METRN expression in sample 26 appears similar, visually 321 localizing near the areas with SNAP25 expression. The remaining SLCO2A1+ barcodes were 322 also proximal to SNAP25 + areas. However, when considering all samples, METRN was 323 primarily measured within neuronal barcodes, while FGFBP2 was measured in Other barcodes 324 (Fig 4). In contrast, the expression of SLCO2A1 , which was downregulated in chronic pain with 325 bulk RNAseq and snRNAseq, was absent in neuronal barcodes. The expected consequence of 326

this downregulation would be increased PGE2 concentration in the area around C2 DRG 327 neurons. 328

## Predicted communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells driving chronic pain 329 states 330

The transcriptional changes in the chronic pain C2 DRG indicate a reorganization of the 331 transcriptomes of certain non-neuronal cell types with little change in the neuronal populations. 332 In order to assess how the non-neuronal cells may exert an impact on neuronal cells, we used 333 interactome analysis. We assessed ligand genes that were upregulated in non-neuronal cell 334 types in chronic pain C2 DRGs and intersected these genes with receptors for these ligands 335 that are expressed by different populations of C2 DRG neurons. This analysis showed 336 interactions between non-neuronal (endothelial, fibroblast and myelinating Schwann cells) and 337 neuronal cells corresponding to a curated database of ligand-receptor interactions (Fig 5A-C). 338 EDN1 and EFNA1 were identified as expressed in endothelial cells with multiple receptors and 339 interactions in neurons: EFNA1 , which encodes an ephrin protein, interacted with tyrosine 340 kinase receptors encoded by EPHA and EPHB genes (Fig 5A-B). EPHA3/5 showed higher 341 expression in nociceptor cells, indicating a more likely interaction with nociceptors, while the 342 remaining EPHA genes were more highly expressed in non-nociceptive neuronal clusters (Fig 343 5C). EDN1 interacts with EDNRA , KEL and ADGRL4 . EDN1 interaction with the receptor 344 EDNRA is likely the most important in this context as a genome association also study found 345 correlation between EDNRA and migraine (Lisi et al., 2006; Miao et al., 2012), previous studies 346 have shown that endothelin 1 causes pain like behavior in rodents through the EDNRA receptor 347 (Zhou et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2002), and the EDN1-EDNRA/EDNRB axis has been linked to 348 oral cancer pain (Zhou et al., 2002; Dang et al., 2020). CSF3 and IL34 were upregulated in 349 chronic pain in endothelial cells, and found to interact with CSF1R and CSF3R , both of which 350 showed higher expression in nociceptor subtypes (Fig 5B-C). IL34 encodes a cytokine that 351 interacts with CSF1R , which has previously been associated with inflammation, as well as 352 several pain conditions including bone pain, arthritis, and neuropathic pain (Schweizerhof et al., 353 2009; Bali et al., 2013; Guan et al., 2016; Ushach and Zlotnik, 2016; Lee et al., 2017; Lin et al., 354 2019) Additionally, CXCL2 , a chemokine characterized in neuropathic pain, and specifically in 355 trigeminal pain, was found to interact with three chemokine receptors in neurons (Iwasa et al., 356 2019; Solis-Castro et al., 2021; Hummig et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2023). 357

Fewer differentially expressed genes were identified in myelinating Schwann cells and fibroblasts, consequently the identified interactions with neurons were limited (Fig 5A-B). CCN3 , which was upregulated in fibroblasts and previously characterized in arthritis (Tokuhiro et al., 2024), was indicated to interact with PLXNA1 , which was broadly expressed in neurons (Fig 5AC). CADM4 is a cell adhesion molecule, the interactions of which exhibited a trend towards increases in nociceptors (Fig 5C). CADM4 activity with ERBB3 and PTPN13 has primarily been characterized in relation to myelin formation, and an increase in CADM4 expression has been associated with abnormal myelination formation (Elazar et al., 2019). CADM4 additionally interacts with KDR , which encodes the receptor VEGFR2. VEGFR2 has been associated with synapse formation and neuronal guidance (De Rossi et al., 2016). The dysregulation of CADM4 could consequently be theorized to impact innervation.

Altogether, a transcriptome pattern reflecting the upregulation of regulators of 369 inflammation, mediated by non-neuronal cells, is observed in C2 DRGs from patients with 370 chronic pain. The transcription patterns are reflected both in the proximal area of neurons as 371

well as in distant areas, suggesting widespread dysregulation across neuronal and non372 neuronal networks. 373

## Discussion 374

Our work on C2 DRGs recovered from patients undergoing arthrodesis surgery with 375 ganglionectomy led to the following major conclusion. First, consistent with the innervation 376 patterns for C2 DRGs that share properties with lumbar DRGs and TGs, we found that these 377 neurons represent a mixed transcriptomic phenotype between DRG and TG neurons. Second, 378 we found that most transcriptomic changes in chronic pain C2 DRGs were associated with non379 neuronal cells including endothelial, myelinating Schwann cells, and fibroblasts. These changes 380 were mostly associated with inflammation and suggest that arthritis of the atlantoaxial joint in 381 humans causes inflammatory-related changes in gene expression in the associated C2 DRG. 382 Finally, integrating our single nucleus sequencing results with spatial transcriptomic data and a 383 ligand-receptor interaction database revealed potential mechanisms that might be pain 384 generators within the C2 DRG in individuals with chronic neck pain. These mechanisms 385 included signaling molecules like endothelin-1 (Zhou et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2002), FKBP5 386 (Linnstaedt et al., 2018; Geranton, 2019; Maiaru et al., 2023; Ahlstrom et al., 2024; Lafta et al., 387 2024), and MNK2 (Moy et al., 2017; Moy et al., 2018; Megat et al., 2019b; Shiers et al., 2023; 388 David et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Mitchell et al., 2024)  that have previously been associated 389 with pain in animal models and human studies, and mechanisms that might promote neuronal 390 sprouting which could cause pathological changes in innervation in chronic neck pain. 391

The human C2 DRG appears to share properties of more caudal DRGs and the TG. The C2 DRG is unique because it innervates areas of the upper neck but also contain neurons that innervate the occipital dura, a specialized tissue protecting the brain that is also innervated by the TG and implicated in migraine and other headache disorders (Keller et al., 1985; Noseda et al., 2019). This anatomical connection is one of the explanation why painful lesions of the upper cervical spine can be associated with headache. (Bogduk and Govind, 2009). We found several genes that were highly expressed in the C2 DRG that are also enriched in the TG, such as FTH1 and PAK1 which were identified in a study in mice (Megat et al., 2019a), and MRGPRX1 which was identified in humans as enriched in the TG (Bhuiyan et al., 2024). While many different atlases of hDRG neurons have been published to-date (Nguyen et al., 2021; TavaresFerreira et al., 2022; Jung et al., 2023; Bhuiyan et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024), none of them have focused on understanding variation in gene expression based on the level of the DRG. Our work shows that the C2 DRG has some unique transcriptomic features and makes the case that future work should strive to better understand molecular features of human sensory neurons along the entire caudal to rostral extent of the peripheral nervous system from sacral DRGs to the TG.

We did not find evidence of neuropathic pain in our chronic neck pain cohort in 408 somatosensory measures, except cold allodynia in 2 patients (Table 2), or in the transcriptome 409 of the C2 DRGs of these individuals. Neck pain is considered of primary musculoskeletal nature, 410 but neuropathic components are possible. The C2 DRG is located between the arch of C1 and 411 the lamina of C2. In this space, the DRG occupies 76% of the foramen height, rendering the 412 ganglion vulnerable to compression in patients with altered spine due to arthritis or fractures (Lu 413 and Ebraheim, 1998). Recent studies of patients with whiplash injury suggest that there is a 414 prominent neuropathic phenotype in these patients with loss of sensory function, mechanical 415 and cold hypersensitivity, neuroinflammation evident with imaging, and increased measures of 416

neurofilaments in plasma, consistent with neuronal injury (Fundaun et al., 2025; Ridehalgh et 417 al., 2025). Table 2 shows some more neuropathic pain characteristics in the acute pain cohort, 418 which may be closer to the whiplash injury phenotype. 419

In DRGs from chronic pain patients in our study, we noted some changes in the neuronal 420 transcriptome that could be associated with neuronal injury (in both the acute and chronic 421 cohort) that were characterized by neurons expressing PKD1 and PDIA2 . These neurons mostly 422 had similar transcriptomes to matching populations within the C2 DRG not expressing these 423 genes, and did not undergo wholesale changes in their transcriptomes as has been reported in 424 animal models of nerve injury (Renthal et al., 2020). To our knowledge, PKD1 and PDIA2 have 425 not previously been reported as markers of nerve injury in the DRG, but they have been 426 associated with nerve injury in Parkinsons disease (Conn et al., 2004; Amadesi et al., 2009; 427 Asaithambi et al., 2011). A question that emerges from these findings is that if there is evidence 428 of nerve injury, and neuropathic pain is common among people with chronic neck pain, why do 429 individuals in this cohort fail to develop signs of neuropathic pain? One possibility is that 430 mechanisms that suppress neuropathic pain are also induced in the DRG of these individuals. 431 For instance, we observed increased ICOS and METRN expression in single nuc RNA 432 sequencing data in patients in the chronic pain cohort. Previous work suggests that ICOS 433 stimulates T-cells to produce interleukin-10 to suppress neuropathic pain (Sankaranarayanan et 434 al., 2023a). Several studies have shown that meteorin, the protein encoded by the METRN 435 gene, can reverse established neuropathic pain states in both mice and rats (Jorgensen et al., 436 2012; Xie et al., 2019; Sankaranarayanan et al., 2023b). While this idea clearly requires further 437 exploration, it is interesting that pain promoting and pain-resolution mechanisms seem to be 438 induced at the same time in the DRGs of the individuals with chronic neck pain studied here. 439 Another explanation for the limited evidence for neuropathic components is our limited ability to 440 detect painful neuropathy, which relies mostly on somatosensory measures at the skin that may 441 not capture painful neural lesions of deep tissues. 442

Our study identifies potential mechanisms of chronic neck pain that can be targeted by 443 therapeutics. These include FKBP5 , endothelin-1 and the endothelin A receptor, MNK2 444 signaling, and IL34 acting via the CSF1 receptor. All of these signaling factors have previously 445 been implicated in pain, but none of them have been associated with neck pain, to our 446 knowledge. This is not surprising because there are few animal models of neck pain and the 447 disorder, while both prevalent and disabling in the human population, is challenging to study at 448 the molecular level. Therefore, an important strength of this study is the molecular insight our 449 work might give to developing new targets for the treatment of neck pain. FKBP5 encodes the 450 FKBP51 protein that is involved in glucocorticoid signaling. The protein has been implicated in 451 the important link between stress and pain and could be targeted with inhibitors of the protein 452 (Linnstaedt et al., 2018; Geranton, 2019; Maiaru et al., 2023). We identified increased 453 endothelin-1 gene expression in endothelial cells of the chronic pain cohort. The receptor for 454 this protein, the endothelin A receptor, is highly expressed in rodent and human nociceptors and 455 activating the receptor causes pain in rodents through signaling cascades that involve voltage 456 gated sodium channels (Zhou et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2002; Bhuiyan et al., 2024). MNK2 457 encodes a mitogen activated protein kinase (MKNK2) that has been implicated in pain through 458 mouse genetic studies and studies on hDRG neurons. Inhibiting MNK with the specific inhibitor 459 eFT508 leads to decreased pain in mouse studies and a reduction in excitability in human 460 nociceptors (Moy et al., 2017; Megat et al., 2019b; Li et al., 2024). IL34 was upregulated in 461 endothelial cells in the DRG of chronic pain patients in this cohort. The receptor for this 462

The copyright holder for this preprint cytokine, CSF1R is strongly expressed across neuronal populations in the human C2 DRG but 463 the consequences of activation of CSF1R in hDRG have not yet been studied. We propose that 464 these targets should be prioritized for future investigation as therapeutic interventions for non465 neuropathic chronic neck pain. 466

## Limitations 467

This study was designed to identify changes in a unique subpopulation of patients, by 468 utilizing an opportunity to recover tissues otherwise discarded during surgery. However, as the 469 primary source was surgical tissue, we did not have access to control samples from a patient 470 population without pain. The physical location of the cervical DRGs in the upper neck makes it 471 challenging to access them during a standard organ donor tissue recovery without an additional 472 incision that can interfere with subsequent tissue recovery for tissue donation. Since recovery of 473 DRGs following organ donation has become an important source of these tissues for research 474 purposes (Shiers et al., 2024), this issue will need to be overcome to obtain control samples of 475 C2 DRGs. 476

Another limitation is the small sample size in this study. C1-2 arthrodesis is an uncommon procedures, and resection of the DRG as part of clinical care is not uniform practice among surgeons. Given the difficulty in obtaining these samples, and the lack of information on C2 DRG in humans we think that the insight provided from this study justifies the small sample size. Previous work on thoracic DRGs recovered during thoracic vertebrectomy surgery demonstrated that findings from an initial, smaller cohort, were replicated in a larger cohort collected over a longer period of time (North et al., 2019; Ray et al., 2023). We plan to use a similar approach as this unique cohort of patients continues to grow.

## Materials and methods 486

## Study design 487

The goal of this study was to characterize human C2 DRGs with molecular precision. For this 488 purpose, DRGs were collected from patients during C1-C2 arthrodesis surgery with 489 ganglionectomy for acute or chronic pain. All human tissue procurement protocols were 490 reviewed and approved by the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and University of Washington 491 (UW) Institutional Review Boards. Patient information, including demographics and 492 characterization of clinical presentation, was collected from medical records and self-reported 493 questionnaires prior to surgery. 494

## Participants and setting 495

Patients eighteen years or older undergoing C1-C2 arthrodesis for neck pain at the University of 496 Washington were prospectively recruited. The study was reviewed and approved by the 497 University of Washington Internal Review Board (IRB number 10916). Informed consent was 498 obtained from all patients, who were offered a $125 gift card for participating in the study. 499

Patients were identified from emergency care settings and clinic visits. We screened for patients 500 who were greater than eighteen years old, undergoing C1-C2 arthrodesis. These patients were 501 identified in a two-pronged manner, whereby the surgeon would notify the research staff of 502 scheduled procedures, and by daily electronic reports accessing the feeds of surgery 503

## Tissue collection 546

DRGs were collected from 11 patients with chronic pain and 11 patients with acute pain 547 according to previously described protocol(Hofstetter, 2025). Briefly, C1 lateral mass screws 548 were placed at the midpoint C1 posterior arch and the lateral mass, and C2 pars screws were 549 placed at a parallel trajectory to the C2 pars to ensure fixation. A bilateral C2 DRG neurectomy 550 was performed and DRGs were immediately placed in powdered dry ice to ensure uniform 551 freezing to preserve RNA. DRGs were shipped to UTD for all sequencing experiments. 552

## Single-nucleus RNA sequencing 553

To achieve characterization at a molecular level, we used 10X single-cell RNA-sequencing of 12 554 DRGs from 12 patients. Briefly, DRGs were thawed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and 555 perineurium as well as cauterized exterior tissue was removed to expose clean C2 DRG bulb. 556 The bulb was dissociated and filtered to minimize myelin contamination and obtain individual 557 nuclei according to previously published 10X protocol (Lacagnina et al., 2024). The RNA from 558 each nucleus was barcoded and libraries were generated according to the manufacturer's 559 protocol for sequencing on a NextSeq2000 at the genomic core at the University of Texas Dallas 560 or Psomogen. 561

## Spatial RNA sequencing 562

We used 10X Visium spatial transcriptomics to achieve near-single resolution data, retaining 563 concurrent transcriptional and spatial information, according to previously published protocol 564 (Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022). Briefly, 13 DRGs from 8 donors were sectioned onto Visium 565 slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and imaged. Tissue permeabilization and 566 binding of oligo primers were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. 567 Sequencing of mRNA libraries was performed on a NextSeq2000 at the genomic core at the 568 University of Texas Dallas and barcodes overlapping neurons were identified visually and 569 confirmed through expression of neuronal marker SNAP25 . 570

## Bulk RNA sequencing 571

To assess transcriptomic differences to the whole DRG associated with pain phenotype, we 572 used bulk RNA sequencing. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 23 C2 DRGs from 13 donors. 573 Three 100µm sections from the bulb were lyzed in TRIZol and RNA extracted with chloroform. 574 DNA was depleted using Qiagen DNase I, according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA 575 integrity was assessed with nanodrop and Qubit and samples with RNA integrity number 2.4-8.1 576 were sequenced using NextSeq2000 for paired-end mRNA sequencing. Five samples were 577 excluded due to low gene expression of neuronal markers according to a previous analysis (Ray 578 et al., 2023), thus 17 DRGs from 13 donors were included in downstream analysis. 579

## Computational analysis 580

## Single-nucleus RNA sequencing Pipeline 581

Sequencing data were processed and mapped to GRCh38 human reference genome 582 (GENCODE release 38) according to 10X protocol using package cellranger. Nuclei with less 583 than 500 genes or more than 7.5% mtRNA were excluded from downstream analysis. Unbiased 584 clustering was performed using the Seurat package v5.2.1. Neuronal and non-neuronal clusters 585 were identified through marker gene enrichment of neuronal markers ( SNAP25 , RBFOX3 and 586

- PRPH ) and non-neuronal markers ( SPARC, MPZ and DCN ). FindAllMarkers was used to 587 identify gene enrichment (|Log2FC&gt;0.5|, adj. p-value&lt;0.05 and min. percent expression in 25% 588 of cluster). The neuronal and non-neuronal clusters were subset into separate objects for 589 downstream analysis. Counts were aggregated for cells of the same cluster for each donor, for 590 differential gene expression analysis with DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). Differential gene 591 expression analysis was carried out to account for batch effects and sex differences: design = ~ 592 Sex + Batch + Condition. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as |Log2FC&gt;0.5|, 593 adj. p-value&lt;0.05. 594

## Bulk RNA sequencing Pipeline 595

Raw sequencing (FASTQ) files were processed with FastQC v0.11.0 to examine Phred scores, 596 per-base sequence, and duplication levels. Reads were soft-clipped (12 bases per read) to 597 discard adapters and low-quality bases during alignment using STAR v2.7.6 (Dobin and 598 Gingeras, 2015) with the GRCh38 human reference genome (GENCODE release 38, primary 599 assembly). Reads were also sorted with STAR and then deduplicated with sambamba v0.8.2 600 (Tarasov et al., 2015). Genes in the ENCODE blacklist were filtered out prior to quantification 601 using bedtools (v2.30.0), and StringTie v2.2.1 was used to obtain normalized count values as 602 transcripts per million (TPM) for each gene of all samples (Quinlan, 2014; Pertea et al., 2016; 603 Amemiya et al., 2019). The featureCounts function of the R package Rsubread (v2.14.2) was 604 used to calculate raw counts for all genes, which was subsequently used for differential 605 expression analysis with DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2019). Differential gene 606 expression analysis was carried out to account for sex differences: design = ~ Sex + Condition. 607 Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as |Log2FC&gt;0.5|, adj. p-value&lt;0.05. 608

## Spatial RNA sequencing Pipeline 609

Spatial RNA sequencing data was analyzed according to previously published 10X protocols. 610 Briefly, FASTQ files were obtained from the 10X Space Ranger's mkfastq pipeline. Space 611 Ranger count pipeline was used align H&amp;E-images and barcode count information and 612 reference transcriptome (GENCODE release 38). Neuron, Surrounding and Other barcodes 613 were identified as previously described (Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022). Cloupe files were 614 obtained to illustrate gene expression in a spatial context. Differential gene expression analysis 615 was carried out with DESeq2 as described in Single-Nucleus RNA sequencing pipeline. Neuron 616 cell diameter was measured from H&amp;E images in CellSens. 617

## CONOS cell subtype predictions 618

Label propagation from previously published lumbar data to the C2 data was performed with the

620

621

624

625

626

R package conos v1.5.2 (Barkas et al., 2019). A conos object was built on the corresponding, processed RNA assays with basicSeuratProc, using umap = TRUE. A graph was then built in

CCA space with the following parameters: con$buildGraph(k=30, k.self=5, space='CCA', ncomps=40,  n.odgenes=2000,  matching.method='mNN', #balance.edge.weights = TRUE,

metric='angular', score.component.variance=TRUE, verbose=TRUE). Cell cluster communities and graph embeddings were processed with default settings, prior to label propagation with

defaults con$propagateLabels. Labels were then back propagated to the Seurat object

627

metadata for comparisons against initial cluster annotations and downstream processing.

## Neural Net Cell Type Predictions 628

| 629     | Cell types were predicted using a neural net algorithm through the scCAMEL package, as              |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 630     | previously described for hDRG (Hu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2024). Processed RNA-seq data was        |
| 631     | extracted from the relevant Seurat objects, including previously published spatial-seq (Tavares-    |
| 632     | Ferreira et al., 2022) and a cross-species harmonized atlas (Bhuiyan et al., 2024). For the latter, |
| 633     | human barcodes were extracted, and gene names were converted from mouse to human with               |
| 634     | the biomaRt package (R).                                                                            |
| 635     | Count and metadata were reassembled into AnnData objects in python for processing. Large            |
| 636     | clusters were downsampled to the mean (cluster size) +0.5*std to minimize a size bias. Data         |
| 637     | were then filtered for low expression and cell cycle genes prior to normalization in line with the  |
| 638     | scCAMEL documentation. Hyperparameter tuning was performed with Optuna using the C2                 |
| 639     | scRNA-seq data as the test/train datasets (learningRate=0.01537, optimizerMmentum=0.8951,           |
| 640     | dropout=0.42, https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10902). After tuning, cell type predictions were           |
|         | against lumbar (visium) as well as lumbar, thoracic, and TG (harmonized)                            |
| 641     | performed datasets.                                                                                 |

| 643     | Previously published curated ligand receptor database (Wangzhou et al., 2021), was intersected      |
| 644     | with the single-nucleus RNA-seq data to identify mechanisms by which DRG endothelial cells,         |
| 645     | fibroblasts, and myelinating Schwann cells may signal to neurons. Cells for each non-neuronal       |
| 646     | cell type and neuronal subpopulation were pseudobulked and the expression (in counts per            |
| 647     | million) of all genes for each cell type was determined. The database was used to identify ligand   |
| 648     | genes that are expressed in each non-neuronal cell type, and corresponding receptors                |
| 649     | expressed in DRG neuron populations. Genes were considered expressed in a cell type if they         |
| 650     | were above the 20th percentile among all genes, as this threshold conservatively differentiated     |
| 651     | non- and lowly-expressed genes from highly expressed genes in kernel density plots of gene          |
| 652     | expression generated for each cell type. Additionally, ligand genes were filtered to include only   |
| 654     | pain donors. The resulting interactome table includes 236 interactions between the non-             |
|         | neuronal cell types and each individual neuron subtype. SankeyMATIC was used to visualize           |
| 655 656 | the unique ligand-receptor interactions, and the ComplexHeatmap v.2.20.0 R package was used         |
| 657     | to visualize the expression of ligand and receptor genes. R v4.4.2 was used for all calculations    |
| 658     | and interactome generation.                                                                         |
