<text><loc_59><loc_61><loc_442><loc_347>RNA sequencing studies on human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) from patients suffering from neuropathic pain show upregulation of OSM, linking this IL-6 family cytokine to pain disorders.  In mice, however, OSM signaling causes itch behaviors through a direct effect on its cognate receptor expressed uniquely by pruriceptive sensory neurons. We hypothesized that an expansion in function of OSM-OSM receptor (OSMR) in sensory disorders in humans could be explained by species differences in receptor expression and signaling. Our in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical findings demonstrate broad expression of OSMR in DRG nociceptors and afferent fibers innervating the superficial and deep skin of humans. In patch-clamp electrophysiology, OSM directly activates human sensory neurons engaging MAPK signaling to promote action potential firing. Using CRISPR editing we show that OSM activation of MAPK signaling is dependent on OSMR and not LIFR in hDRG.  Bulk, single-nuclei, and single-cell RNAseq of OSM-treated hDRG cultures reveal expansive similarities in the transcriptomic signature observed in pain DRGs from neuropathic patients, indicating that OSM alone can orchestrate transcriptomic signatures associated with pain. We conclude that OSMOSMR signaling via MAPKs is a critical signaling factor for DRG plasticity that may underlie neuropathic pain in patients.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_65><loc_442><loc_351>Neuropathic pain is an important clinical problem that is not adequately treated by any existing pharmacotherapy ( 1 ). While animal models give tremendous insight into pain mechanisms, they have not led to successful clinical translation to-date ( 2, 3 ). Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated that silencing neurons in the DRG with local anesthetic injection produces rapid and near-complete pain relief in almost all patients ( 4-6 ). Other studies show that DRG neurons from patients with neuropathic pain, but not those without neuropathic pain, generate spontaneous action potentials (also known as spontaneous activity or SA) originating at the soma in vitro , strongly implicating SA as a key mechanism driving neuropathic pain ( 7, 8 ). Transcriptomic studies on surgically resected DRGs from patients, and on DRGs recovered from organ donors who died with a history of neuropathic pain reveal that changes in cytokine and chemokine signaling in the DRG may play a critical role in driving the changes in sensory neuron physiology that cause neuropathic pain ( 7, 9, 10 ). Interestingly, some of these underlying mechanisms appear to be sex-specific ( 9 ), consistent with mechanistic studies in animal models ( 11, 12 ). A key gap in knowledge is whether these cytokines or chemokines are sufficient to produce transcriptomic, signaling or electrophysiological changes that are seen in the DRGs of individuals with neuropathic pain.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_366><loc_432><loc_443>OSM is an IL-6 family cytokine that is involved in many inflammatory diseases ( 13 ) and has also been linked to disorders affecting the sensory nervous system such as atopic dermatitis, and prurigo nodularis ( 14-17 ). OSM is upregulated in itchy skin lesions ( 15-19 ) and mutations in the human OSMR gene, which encodes the OSM receptor (OSMR), cause familial primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (FPLCA), a</text>

These mutations cause a loss of functional signaling at OSMR leading to keratinocyte dysfunction promoting nodule formation in skin ( 14 ). The OSM receptor (OSMR) forms a complex with gp130 to induce signaling by OSM and can complex with IL31RA to transduce IL31 signaling ( 20 ). Vixarelimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks functional signaling for both IL31 and OSM by binding OSMR. Vixarelimab treatment led to relief of itch and clearing of skin lesions in a phase 2 trial of patients suffering from prurigo nodularis ( 16 ). While there is a clear role for OSM/OSMR in skin diseases that cause itch in humans, OSM upregulated is also found in painful tissues in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis ( 21 ) and OSM is strongly upregulated in the DRG of males suffering from neuropathic pain undergoing thoracic vertebrectomy surgery ( 7, 9 ), suggesting a broader role of this cytokine in chronic pain disorders. The primary goal of the work described here was to thoroughly characterize OSM-OSMR signaling in the human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) to gain insight into the potential for targeting this signaling pathway for the treatment of chronic pain.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_313><loc_444><loc_442>OSM shows divergence in its receptor binding and signaling mechanisms between mice, rats, and humans ( 22-24 ) making studying OSM signaling in a human cellular context paramount for translational relevance. In mice the cytokine binds OSMR and primarily induces JAK/STAT signaling ( 22-25 ). In humans OSM binds OSMR and LIFR and induces both JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling ( 22-25 ). Previous studies in mice show that OSM acts specifically on a distinct subset of nociceptors causing sensitization of these neurons to promote itch behaviors in mice via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway ( 17 ), although another study found that OSM can suppress itch behaviors in mice ( 26 ).</text>

In rats, where OSMR signaling more closely resembles the signaling seen at human receptors ( 24 ), OSM acts on a broader population of DRG nociceptors, induces MAPK signaling, and causes clear behavioral signs of nociceptive sensitization that can promote chronic pain ( 29 ). We hypothesized that OSM may act on multiple classes of nociceptors in humans where OSMR-mediated MAPK signaling could lead to the generation of action potentials which would cause pain in patients.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_209><loc_443><loc_251>Our studies on hDRG neurons show that OSMR is expressed by several different subsets of nociceptors, with high expression in putative silent nociceptors ( 30 ), allowing for widespread activation of MAPK signaling upon OSM stimulation.</text>

For each of the bulk, single-nuclei, and single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics experiments, dissociated DRG cells were obtained from a single donor and processed in ≥ 3 technical replicates. The transcriptomic data from hDRGs of neuropathic pain patients used for comparative analysis were previously published ( 7, 9 ). Cultures were treated with OSM or vehicle for 6 hours in the transcriptomic studies, while in the proteomic studies, explant slices were treated for 3 hours. MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling assays were conducted after a 30 min incubation with the respective treatment conditions. Data analysis for all experiments except for the RNA sequencing and proteomic studies was conducted in a blinded manner with respect to experimental conditions or sex. Sample sizes for the characterization and functional assays follow what has been generally used in the field ( 7, 31, 32 ), with the limited availability of hDRGs also influencing our decisions.

The raw image files were brightened and contrasted in Olympus CellSens software (v1.18), and then analyzed manually one cell at a time for expression of each gene target. Cell diameters were measured using the polyline tool. Total neuron counts were acquired by counting all of the probe-labeled neurons and all neurons that were clearly outlined by DAPI (satellite cell) and contained lipofuscin in the overlay image. For OSMR , CALCA and P2RX3 RNAscope, we summed the neuronal counts for each target/subpopulation from all images from each section, and then calculated the population percentages for that section. We averaged the population percentages from 3 sections to yield the final population value for each donor.

Based on several other studies including IF analyses of human skin biopsies, OSMR-positive cutaneous innervation was expected to be among numerous CGRP-positive 'peptidergic' C-fibers that have previously been shown to terminate among several distinctly different skin structures including the epidermis, dermal papillae, papillary dermis, capillaries, sweat glands, arterioles, and hair follicles ( 39-41 ). This innervation has been physiologically and molecularly implicated as pruriceptive nociceptors.</text>

In this combination, the established pan-neuronal biomarker PGP9.5 provided a basis for assessing whether and where there was any innervation that co-labeled for OSMR as well as assessing whether OMSR was expressed on other non-innervation components of the skin.  A second slide of alternating sections from  each biopsy assessed OMSR labeling in combination with a polyclonal sheep CGRP 1 o antibody (Abcam #195382) and donkey anti-sheep Alexa488 conjugated 2 o in order to assess co-expression of OSMR and CGRP as predicted from the DRG transcriptome. Given that the primary antibodies were raised in different species, the incubations were run as a simultaneous cocktail. These and all other IF combinations below included a DAPI for IF labeling of cell nuclei.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_320><loc_442><loc_431>The IF ITD-CMA also included labeling for Somatostatin (SST) because the DRG transcriptome detected uniquely high levels of SST mRNA among a distinct second set of OSMR-negative, CGRP high-expressing neurons that are implicated as peptidergic C-fiber silent nociceptors.  Therefore, IF combinations were assessed on other slides of alternating sections from each biopsy utilizing combinations of a rabbit polyclonal SST 1 o antibody (ThermoFisher # 17512-1-AP) with the PGP9.5 and CGRP antibodies as described above.

<text><loc_59><loc_93><loc_443><loc_361>First, the above label combinations confirmed that OSMR and SST IF was detectable among subsets of cutaneous  innervation, and that both completely colabeled for CGRP. Second, both had subsets of innervation and/or other skin locations that they uniquely labeled. However, there were other sites where there was similar labeling indicative of potential co-labeling. Therefore, given that the two best OSMR and SST antibodies we identified were both rabbit polyclonals, a method documented previously used which is a two step double label procedure in which one of the 1 o antibodies was incubated first followed by the donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 conjugate, and then a second incubation used the other 1 o antibody followed by the donkey anti-rabbit Alexa488 conjugate. While this had the possibility that the first 1 o may be double labeled with both fluorophores, anything that is uniquely labeled with the second 1 o will only be labeled with Alexa488 ( 45 ).  Therefore, another slide is incubated reversing the order of the 1 o antibodies to see if that may also have double labeling and additional unique labeling. Interpreting single versus double molecular properties, such as OSMR and SST herein, is a combination of whether, where, and to what extent unique and double labeling and unique labeling occurs.</text>

We sought to assess potential species differences in gene expression in humans using DRG tissues derived from organ donors. We first examined previously published datasets from hDRG ( 51, 54 ) and observed an expansion of OSMR expression, including at least 3 subtypes of nociceptors in humans, pruritogen receptor enriched nociceptors, putative silent nociceptors, and putative C-low threshold mechano-receptors (LTMRs) (Fig. 1A). We then used markers for these subpopulations and conducted multi-channel RNAscope in situ hybridization to confirm OSMR expression in organ donor DRGs.

OSMR + neurons co-expressed NPPB , consistent with pruritogen receptor enriched nociceptors, and CHRNA3 , consistent with putative silent nociceptors (Fig. 1B-D) ( 55 ). A subset of OSMR + neurons also coexpressed GFRA2 , consistent with c-LTMRs (Fig. 1E-G). OSMR+ neurons also expressed broader nociceptor markers such as CALCA and P2RX3 and cell size distribution was also consistent with previous observations for hDRG nociceptors (Fig. S1A-E). We examined potential sex differences in OSMR mRNA expression in these experiments and did not note any differences between male and female organ donor hDRGs (Fig. 1D and G, Table S1). We also noted OSMR mRNA puncta outside of neuronal cell bodies in hDRG (Fig. S1E). Using a marker for satellite glia cells (satglia, FABP7 ) ( 56, 57 ) and a marker for immune cell populations that is enriched in macrophages (CD68) ( 51 ), we found that OSMR was also expressed in satglia and immune cells in the hDRG (Fig. 1H and I, Table S1), again with no sex differences.</text>

To confirm the expression and lack of sex differences findings with an independent method, we also analyzed a previously published spatial ATAC-seq dataset of hDRG ( 58 ).

OSMR overlapped with populations that also expressed SST , and a subset of CGRP-expressing human nociceptors that are likely silent nociceptors ( 30, 59, 60 ). OSMR and SST IF were detected as subsets among all the cutaneous innervation revealed by anti-PGP9.5 staining (Fig. 2A-D; Fig. S4A, B,E, and Fig. S5A-D). Both OSMR and SST consistently co-labeled for CGRP, aligning with sequencing data showing that these populations should overlap in humans (Fig. 2E-H and Fig. S4C,D,F) ( 30, 54, 59 ). However, CGRP was also consistently expressed among innervation that was OSMR and SST-negative.  SST IF was detected only on nerve terminals with additional very low-level expression on keratinocytes (Fig. 2A,B,E,F; Fig. S4A,C; Fig. S5A,B,E,F).

<text><loc_59><loc_87><loc_444><loc_373>The OSMR, SST, PGP9.5, and CGRP IF combinations (Fig. 2I,J) revealed that OSMR and SST immunolabeling was entirely co-expressed among the CGRP C-fibers and their terminals within the papillary dermis and dermal papillae. However, OSMR and SST was mostly not co-expressed and likely on separate sets of CGRP fibers. The proportions of OSMR and SST positive fibers was qualitatively similar. Still other CGRP fibers were both OSMR and SST negative. Since, the keratinocytes robustly expressed OSMR, it was difficult to detect whether OSMR was expressed among the CGRP innervation that terminates in the epidermis. However, OSMR was expressed on fibers that were in contact with the basement membrane and likely to terminate in the epidermis (Fig. 2D).  Whereas, keratinocytes had no confounding SST labeling, SST was detected on some intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENFs, Fig. 2B inset a) but, for the most part, was not seen on SST-positive PGP9.5 labeled fibers whose endings continued into the epidermis. Unlike in rodents and even monkeys where  CGRP-IF is readily express on ~10% of IENF supplied by CGRP-positive fibers in the subjacent dermis ( 61, 62 ), IENF in human skin biopsies rarely label for CGRP even though it is expressed in the upper dermal fibers up to but not beyond where they penetrate the epidermis as seen by PGP9.5-IF.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_87><loc_444><loc_373>Previous publications have documented that arterioles and arteriole-venule shunts have the highest innervation density in the skin of humans and most mammalian species ( 41, 44 ). Located in the relative low collagen fiber density reticular dermis deep to the papillary dermis, the cutaneous arterioles and arteriole-venule shunts are composed of three layers (Fig. S4E,F insets). The lumen is lined with the tunica intima composed of a single layer of flat endothelial cells, which is surrounded by a thick tunica media composed of several layers of circumferentially and diagonally oriented smooth muscle. The tunica media is in turn surround by an outer collagen fiber dense tunica adventitia, which is where all of a dense innervation terminates which is stratified by different types. First, noradrenergic CGRP- sympathetic terminals are concentrated near the tunica media whereas sensory endings supplied overwhelmingly by C-fibers and a few A δ are distributed throughout the epidermis of which nearly all are CGRP+ (39, 42). Of particular interest herein, nearly all of the CGRP+ innervation to the outer half of the tunica adventitia co-labeled only for OSMR and a small proportion only for SST (Fig. S4D). However, most of the innervation to the inner half co-express both OMSR and SST (Fig. S4E,F). A small portion of CGRP fibers lacked OMSR or SST labeling (Fig. S4C, D).</text>

Consistent with the innervation observed at all levels of the skin, the dermal nerves located in the reticular innervation contained a mix of fibers of which OSMR and/or SST were only expressed among CGRP-positive fibers. Among these some were only OSMR-positive, some were only SST-positive, some were positive for both OSMR and SST, while others were negative for OSMR and SST.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_156><loc_443><loc_233>Overall, these results support the conclusion that OSMR is expressed in multiple populations of human C fibers and is found in nerve terminals innervating multiple areas of human skin suggesting that these nerve fibers are able to detect stimuli superficially, but also at deeper structures in the skin consistent with a role in both pain and itch and broad expression in what are potentially dermal silent nociceptors ( 30 ).</text>

We cultured hDRG neurons recovered from organ donors and after 4 days in vitro (DIV) stimulated with increasing concentrations of OSM (3-30 ng/mL). We used the target of MNK signaling, eIF4E phosphorylation at Serine 209, as a functional readout since OSM is known to stimulate MAPK signaling in certain cell types ( 63, 64 ) and eIF4E phosphorylation by MNK is a specific biochemical readout of this signaling pathway, and MNK-eIF4E signaling has been extensively linked to nociceptor sensitization in rodent and human studies ( 31, 32, 50, 65-70 ). We observed a concentration-dependent increase in eIF4E phosphorylation with OSM treatment for 30 min (Fig. 3A-E). This effect was completely blocked by the specific MNK inhibitor</text>

We used immunofluorescence for peIF4E to assess signaling in specific cells in intact hDRG slices. Consistent with culture experiments, we observed increased p-eIF4E in neuronal cell bodies (Fig. S6A-C), but we also detected increased p-eIF4E around neurons consistent with expression of OSMR in satglia (Fig. S6D).</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_174><loc_443><loc_390>In mice, OSM does not directly excite nociceptors but sensitizes them to itch mediators ( 17 ). Using patch-clamp electrophysiology on hDRG neurons recovered from organ donors we found that OSM directly excites DRG neurons causing them to fire action potentials that commence shortly after OSM (10 ng/mL) exposure (Fig 3K). OSMinduced action potential firing was preceded by instability in the resting membrane potential resembling what has been described in rodent and human nociceptors from neuropathic pain models and patients ( 71-79 ), respectively, and referred to as depolarizing spontaneous fluctuations (DSFs) (Fig. 3K-M). This was followed by firing of action potentials that continued even after OSM was removed from the bath (Fig. 3N-P). The effect of OSM was blocked by eFT508 treatment, indicating that MNK-eIF4E signaling drives this change in excitability (Fig. 3Q). These experiments show that OSM directly excites hDRG neurons, illustrating another species difference in the actions of this cytokine on nociceptors.</text>

Specific antagonists of these receptors have actions of OSM on hDRG neurons. To assess this, we turned to CRISPR editing of OSMR and LIFR in hDRG neurons using a recently described approach of plasmid transfection of CRISPR enzymes and guide RNAs into hDRG neurons in vitro (46) . Transfection with plasmids led to robust expression of mCherry reporter in hDRG neurons and other cell types (Fig. 5A and B, Fig. S7 A-C), as expected. Knockout of OSMR led to a complete loss of OSM-induced p-eIF4E increase but this effect was intact in the negative control, and in cells where LIFR was knocked out (Fig. 5A-C). Therefore, CRISPR knockout of these receptors demonstrates that OSMR transduces OSM-mediated increases in MNK signaling to eIF4E.</text>

We reasoned that this time course would be sufficient to induce transcriptional changes in cells expressing OSMR and/or LIFR, and also to induce network changes that might be caused by factors released by cells in response to OSM. First, we isolated total RNA from the mixed hDRG cultures and did bulk RNA sequencing on 4 vehicle and 4 OSM independently treated culture wells from a single donor. The bulk RNA sequencing results revealed that OSM induces clear transcriptional responses, as evidenced by the distinct clustering of OSM-treated and vehicle-treated samples on the PCA plot (Fig. 6A). Several cytokines and chemokines were significantly upregulated, including IL6 , LIF , OSM , CXCL1 , CXCL3 , CXCL13 , CCL2 , and CCL7 (Fig. 6B), many of which are strongly implicated in driving JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling, sensitizing nociceptors, and contributing to the activation of a proinflammatory milieu ( 83-85 ). SOCS3 , a potent suppressor of JAK/STAT signaling, was one of the most enriched genes, likely functioning as an intrinsic mechanism to control the excessive activation of inflammatory pathways driven by cytokine-induced responses ( 86 ). Additionally, IL24 and CCL11 , which showed increased expression and are less well-characterized in the context of pain, may play roles in modulating immune responses and neuronal-glial interactions. Key pro-nociceptive ligands and vascular remodeling factors, VEGFA and ANGPTL4 , were also significantly elevated in OSMtreated samples ( 87 ). Additionally, neuronal-associated genes like TAC1 , RAMP1 , OSMR , OXTR , and CACNB3 , alongside circadian regulators BMAL2 and GPR176 , potentially linking these pathways to diurnal pain fluctuations.

These findings suggest that OSM-induced transcriptional changes recapitulate critical aspects of the transcriptional landscape seen in neuropathic pain conditions (Fig. 6C and D). Our findings were consistent across sexes, indicating that differences in cell type proportions likely drive most sex-specific mechanisms in neuropathic pain rather than intrinsic differences in receptor biology and signaling.</text>

We identified 61,749 nuclei and annotated cell types based on their established marker genes (Fig. 7A-D, and Fig. S8A): satglia (enriched for KCNJ10 , GLUL , and FABP7 ), myelinating Schwann cells/Schwann_M (expressing MPZ and MBP), and non-myelinating Schwann cells/Schwann_N (expressing SCN7A). Cell clusters also included Fibroblasts ( DCN , PDGFRA , MGP ), macrophages ( CD163 , CSF1R , CCR2 , MRC1 , LYZ2 ), B cells ( CD79A , CD79B , IGHD , IGHM , MS4A1 ), T cells ( CD3E , CD8A , CCR7 , CD4 ), endothelial cells ( PECAM1 , CLDN5 , EGFL7 ), and dendritic cells ( FCER1A , CST3 ). We performed differential expression analysis using the muscat R package, which revealed subpopulation-specific transcriptomic changes induced by OSM. Among the identified cell types, satglia and fibroblasts exhibited the most pronounced differential changes in their transcriptomic profiles, based on a Log2FC ≥ 0.585 or ≤ -0.585 and an adjusted p-value (p_adj.loc) ≤ 0.05. Additionally, we observed the highest degree of overlap in transcriptional changes among the satglia, Schwann_M, and Schwann_M subpopulations, suggesting that these glial cell types share common signaling pathways and exhibit relatively similar cell state responses to OSM. Osteopontin (SPP1), significantly increased in satglia, regulates neurite outgrowth, mechanosensory thresholds, and knee pain via integrin-mediated ERK1/2 signaling. Neuregulin 1 ( NRG1 ) overexpression in satglia suggests neuron-glia communication via ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, modulating neuronal excitability and facilitating repair processes. Ion channel and receptor genes like TRPM3 and P2RX7 were significantly decreased in satglia.

We also observed that several members of the SERPINE family, such as SERPINE1 , SERPINE3 , SERPINEB3 , and SERPINEB4 , were notably upregulated in Fibroblasts, indicating their involvement in a profibrotic cell state characterized by enhanced extracellular matrix remodeling, and inflammatory signaling (Fig. 7G).</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_156><loc_443><loc_425>Finally, we used an independent method, PIP-seq, to capture whole cells from hDRG cultures. Cultures were generated from an independent organ donor and treated with either vehicle or OSM for 6 hours at 4 days in vitro (DIV). While we again obtained only a small number of neurons, we successfully captured representative populations of other cell types present in the hDRG. Using the same markers, we classified 14,187 cells into satglia, Schwann_N, Schwann_M, fibroblasts, pericytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Fig. 8A-D and Fig. S8B). As expected, the scRNAseq approach detected more differentially expressed genes across all subpopulations compared to snRNA-seq, with satglia and fibroblasts remaining among the top differentially regulated populations.  In OSM-treated satglia (Fig. 8F), upregulated genes included CCL2 , promoting immune recruitment; NRG3 and MAML2 , regulating neuralglial signaling; and MACF1 and FNDC3A , supporting cytoskeletal integrity. DYRK1A , FTO , and KMT2C reflected signaling and metabolic shifts, while SMAD1 , TMEM132A , and THBS2 , and MMP14 driving stress responses, and ECM remodeling.

<text><loc_59><loc_87><loc_443><loc_373>To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of OSM at both the mRNA and protein levels within DRGs, we sought to investigate changes in the proteomic landscape. Proteomic analysis was performed on acutely sliced hDRG explants (4 Vehicle and 4 OSM) using the SomaScan platform (Fig. S9A and B). Our analysis revealed 220 upregulated proteins, including those encoded by genes such as ICAM1 , FMR1 , IGF1R , PTPN9 , TLR1 , TLR3 , COL6A3 , SEMA3E , SERPINH1 , TRIM28 , MAPK13 , EEF1A1 , and EIF2AK4 , (Fig. S9B and C). Many of the upregulated proteins are involved in the TNF, VEGF, and P13K-Akt signaling pathways, which are also implicated in pain. Finally, to integrate our findings, we performed an analysis on the OSM-treated proteomics data, as well as bulk RNAseq, snRNAseq, and scRNAseq data (Fig. S10). While we observed few correlations between the OSM proteomics data and both the OSM bulk RNAseq and pain bulk RNAseq datasets, we noted that some of the most robustly upregulated proteins correlated with increases in gene expression in specific cell types, most notably in the OSM scRNAseq data (Fig. S10). Altogether, our multi-omics approach provides clear evidence that OSM can drive distinct molecular responses, both at the transcript and protein level, across multiple cell populations in the hDRG.</text>

OSM is found in macrophages within the DRG making these cells a prime candidate for the cell type that might release OSM in the context of neuropathic pain. The cytokine activates MAPK signaling in hDRG neurons, exemplified by MNK1/2 activation and eIF4E phosphorylation. This arm of the MAPK signaling pathway is linked to neuropathic pain in animal models ( 65, 67, 69, 88, 89 ), and inhibition of MNK signaling reduces SA in hDRG neurons recovered from individuals with neuropathic pain ( 8 ). Consistent with this, OSM causes action potential firing in hDRG neurons from organ donors with no history of neuropathic pain. The lasting effect of OSM on these neurons is reversed when MNK activity is inhibited with the specific inhibitor eFT508. Finally, OSM treatment of hDRG cultures causes transcriptomic changes that closely resemble those observed in patients with neuropathic pain ( 7, 9 ). Altogether, these findings illustrate that OSM signaling is sufficient to drive a state in hDRG that recapitulates key molecular and physiological findings in neuropathic pain patients.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_296><loc_441><loc_442>Genetic ( 14 ), basic science clinical ( 15, 17 ) and pre-clinical studies ( 17 ), and clinical trial data ( 16 ) support the hypothesis that OSM is involved in skin diseases that cause itch in patients. Although some previous animal studies support a role for OSM in pain ( 27-29 ), why have these clinical studies failed to link the cytokine to pain in humans? One key factor is that the OSMR mutations linked to itch in FPLCA are a loss of function mutation that renders the receptor incapable of transducing signals from either OSM or IL31 ( 14 ). Loss of function of OSMR in FPLCA seems to cause changes in keratinocyte cell cycle leading to bumpy keratinous deposits in skin that then become itchy, causing this symptom in the disease. Other pruritic diseases like prurigo nodularis</text>

Interestingly, pain in prurigo nodularis is often described in terms that are associated with neuropathic pain such as burning and shooting pain and is often treated with gabapentinoids ( 90 ). Vixarelimab, which blocks OSMR signaling by OSM and IL31, effectively reduces itching and skin lesions in prurigo nodularis patients, but any effects on pain were not reported in that study and there were no pain endpoints in the published trial protocol ( 16 ). We provide clear evidence that OSMR is expressed in multiple classes of human nociceptors, all of which also express the signal transducer gp130 ( 54, 91 ), and that these neurons innervate the outmost layers of skin, where itch signals are produced, and deeper layers, where pain signals from the skin originate. We anticipate that further examination of symptom resolution in pruritic disease trials for vixarelimab or similar therapeutics will find positive effects of these biologics/drugs on pain in these patients.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_279><loc_444><loc_442>We describe a profound species difference in OSMR expression between mice and humans wherein there is an expansion of expression in humans to multiple classes of nociceptors from the relatively specific expression of OSMR in pruriceptive neurons in adult mice ( 17, 59 ). What drives this difference in expression across species? While the precise mechanisms are not currently known, we speculate that this may be functionally linked to an expansion of the TrkA-positive subset of neurons in the hDRG ( 54, 92-94 ). In mice, TrkA is expressed in all DRG neurons in early life but is shut off after birth in neurons that become the so-called non-peptidergic class of nociceptors ( 95 ). Previous studies show that OSM is required for the development of a large subset of mostly nonpeptidergic nociceptors wherein OSM knockout mice lose ~ 20-30% of nociceptors and</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_47><loc_442><loc_263>have decreased nociceptive responses to heat and chemical irritants ( 27 ). In humans, this distinction between peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors appears to be lost because all human nociceptors express the peptidergic markers calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and TrkA and all human nociceptors also express TRPV1 ( 92, 93 ). This fundamental difference supports the idea that transcriptional programs controlling gene expression in nociceptors are under selection pressure, and OSMR is likely one of these genes. Genomic-based structural differences in OSM that change the pharmacology of the cytokine across species also support this conclusion for the cytokine-receptor signaling module ( 22 ). While previous studies have examined how genomic variation in TRP channels play a role in climatic adaptation for animals like ground squirrels and camels, or for capsaicin sensitivity in birds ( 96, 97 ), little attention has been paid to evolutionary adaptation that may contribute to neuro-immune interactions that make certain species, like humans, susceptible to neuropathic pain.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_301><loc_437><loc_430>A significant limitation is that our work on hDRG can only give us insight into regulation of the activity of the peripheral cells we have studied in this work. Ultimately pain is a sensory and emotional experience that requires brain processing, which is beyond the experimental scope of our work. Activity in DRG neurons is a key driver of neuropathic pain as exemplified by many clinical studies that demonstrate a rapid alleviation of pain with peripheral nerve block in neuropathic pain patients ( 4-6 ). We hypothesize that patients with a clear peripheral driver of their neuropathic pain are the most likely to potentially benefit from OSM/OSMR-targeting therapeutics.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_47><loc_442><loc_385>OSM/OSMR signaling is unlikely to act alone to produce neuropathic pain. Instead, OSM upregulation in the DRG or in painful tissues should be viewed as part of a network of changes that drives the disease state. From this perspective, our work is limited by its reductionist approach to studying OSM in isolation. RNA sequencing studies on hDRG samples from patients suffering from neuropathic pain show transcriptional changes that are likely driven by immune cell state alterations within the DRG ( 7, 9, 10 ).  Similar changes may also occur in the peripheral nerve and in peripheral tissues. Single cell and/or spatial transcriptomic studies can give deeper insight into how these changes in specific immune cells drive signaling networks in the neuro-immune axis to cause pain. Recent studies using single nucleus sequencing from synovial tissues in treatment resistant rheumatoid arthritis ( 21 ) and in chronic low back pain ( 98 ) show the power of this approach for identifying patient subtypes based on cellstates and how this can be linked to clinical phenotypes, like pain. Increased access to hDRG tissues accompanied by detailed medical histories can enable recovery of tissues that can make these studies possible ( 99 ). Ultimately these studies will likely be needed to understand how to target OSM/OSMR signaling for the treatment of pain. While clinical trials in neuropathic pain for biologics like vixarelimab are warranted based on our findings, we envision approaches that alter pathological immune cell states as an important future approach to treating neuropathic pain. Such an approach has been used in preclinical pain models with success ( 100 ).</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_214><loc_442><loc_343>Our work is an example of the importance of a human-first approach to understanding neuropathic pain mechanisms. Prior to our experiments, major species differences in OSM/OSMR signaling were identified informing our hypotheses leading to these studies ( 23-25 ). We discovered pervasive differences in OSMR localization and signaling in hDRG where OSM leads to direct excitation of hDRG neurons through MAPK signaling and induces transcriptional changes that mimic those seen in neuropathic pain patients. OSM/OSMR-signaling is a bona-fide target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_61><loc_443><loc_283>Fig. 2. Immunofluorescence labeling of human palmar skin biopsies reveals the expression of OSMR and SST in small nerve fibers, free nerve endings (FNE), terminal glia, and keratinocytes. IF labeled antigen combinations are noted above uppercase lettered panels for separate red and green IF channels (left and center images) and for merged IF (right images) with cell nuclei co-labeled for DAPI in blue IF. Epidermal layers of keratinocytes from deep to superficial are: sb, stratum basalis; ss, stratum spinosum; sg, stratum granulosum; sl, stratum lucidum; sc, stratum corneum.  Arrowheads indicate IF sensory endings in the epidermis and invaginating dermal papillae (dp). Straight arrows indicate axons and endings in the collagen-dense papillary dermis (pd) subjacent to the epidermis. Arrowheads and arrows are red or green, indicating innervation detected by IF for only one corresponding antigen, and yellow for co-labeling. Scale bar in A, 50µm. Larger solid line rectangles in each image are 2X enlargements of locations in smaller rectangles as indicated by corresponding lower-case letters in the right images of each panel. Dash-lined rectangles are inserts taken from images of other sections. A-D ) SST and OSMR are respectively expressed as subsets among the total innervation labeled for PGP9.5 (yellow indicators) whereas other innervation is SST and OSMR negative (green indicators). E-H ) All SST and OSMR fibers are co-expressed with CGRP (yellow indicators), but other CGRP fibers are SST or OSMR negative (green indicators). Note that SST is expressed virtually only on innervation whereas OSMR is also expressed on keratinocytes, sometimes mostly in sg ( G, H between broad red arrows), as well as among other cells in the dermis (small white arrows). On occasion, SST can be detected in endings that definitively terminate in the epidermis ( B, inset a ) but OSMR IF on keratinocytes obscures whether OSMR is expressed on endings that penetrate the epidermis. C,G ) OSMR is expressed on terminal glia of Meissner corpuscles (mc) as well as a subset CGRP endings that terminate on the glia (curved arrows). I,J ) sequential double labeling as described in the methods, first with SST followed by OSMR ( I ) and then first with OSMR ( J ) reveals axons and endings and axons that only express SST, only OSMR, or SST and OSMR.</text>

F-I ) Representative confocal images showing p-eIF4E with and without OSM and eFT508 treatment for 30 min. OSM-induced increases in p-eIF4E signal intensities were reversed by MNK1/2 inhibitor eFT508 (25 nM). N = 9 technical replicates for Vehicle + Vehicle, Vehicle + 10 ng/mL OSM, Vehicle + eFT508, and OSM+ eFT508 conditions. Cultures were prepared from lumbar DRGs from 2 donors. Data represent means - SEM. Ordinary one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's posttest: ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001. Scale bars, 100 µm. K-L ) A representative raw trace demonstrating the onset of action potentials during OSM application. M-N ) Representative trace of a neuron firing action potentials after an initial OSM application, which slows after a washout period. Another application of OSM triggers action potential discharge once again, but after co-treatment with eFT508, action potential firing is suppressed. After a washout period, a second treatment with OSM alone results in an action potential firing rate similar to the first OSM treatment. Data represent means - SEM. Wilcoxon test: * P < 0.05.</text>
