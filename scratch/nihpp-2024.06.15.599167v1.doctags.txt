<text><loc_59><loc_47><loc_443><loc_277>ABSTRACT : Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a prevalent complication of diabetes mellitus that is caused by metabolic toxicity to peripheral axons. We aimed to gain deep mechanistic insight into the disease process using bulk and spatial RNA sequencing on tibial and sural nerves recovered from lower leg amputations in a mostly diabetic population. First, our approach comparing mixed sensory and motor tibial and purely sensory sural nerves shows key pathway differences in affected nerves, with distinct immunological features observed in sural nerves. Second, spatial transcriptomics analysis of sural nerves reveals substantial shifts in endothelial and immune cell types associated with severe axonal loss. We also find clear evidence of neuronal gene transcript changes, like PRPH, in nerves with axonal loss suggesting perturbed RNA transport into distal sensory axons. This motivated further investigation into neuronal mRNA localization in peripheral nerve axons generating clear evidence of robust localization of mRNAs such as SCN9A and TRPV1 in human sensory axons. Our work gives new insight into the altered cellular and transcriptomic profiles in human nerves in DPN and highlights the importance of sensory axon mRNA transport as an unappreciated potential contributor to peripheral nerve degeneration.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_68><loc_443><loc_154>Diabetes mellitus is a public health problem and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of its most common and debilitating consequences, affecting an estimated 37.3 million people in the US alone (1, 2) and 463 million people worldwide (3, 4). Distal symmetric sensory polyneuropathy is the most common form of DPN, accounting for approximately 75% of DPN cases (4). The prevalence of DPN is estimated to be at least 20% in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) after 20 years and 50% in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) after 10 years (4).</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_169><loc_442><loc_431>DPN affects peripheral sensory nerves, and the long axons that innervate the feet are usually the first to be affected. DPN causes pain in about half of affected individuals making it the most common cause of neuropathic pain (5). Many transcriptomic, proteomic and lipidomic studies have been published using DPN rodent models to understand the underlying pathology in peripheral nerves that causes neurodegeneration and pain in diabetes (6-13). In rodent models there is clear evidence for inflammation driven by endoneurial immune cell infiltration causing increased oxidative stress and neuroimmune signaling that results in nociception and promotes axonal degeneration (7, 9, 10). Accompanying changes in the proteome (13) and lipid profile (6, 14) of peripheral nerves in rodent diabetes models are consistent with transcriptomic studies. We are unaware of any previous studies examining transcriptomic profiles of human peripheral nerves from DPN patients, however, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic studies have been conducted on human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) recovered from organ donors who died with a history of DPN pain (15, 16). These studies highlight signs of neurodegeneration (15), macrophage proliferation or infiltration (15) and altered mRNA processing (16) within the DRG associated with pain in DPN. A primary goal of our work was to use spatial and bulk RNA sequencing to understand how the peripheral tibial and sural nerves are changed in individuals with DPN. Our underlying hypothesis was that these techniques would reveal molecular insight</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_84><loc_433><loc_106>Human DRG neurons that give rise to sensory axons have a highly polarized structure with axons that extend a large distance away from the nucleus and cell body (17, 18).</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_116><loc_440><loc_394>Measurements from a study examining peripheral nerves in human cadavers show that the average length of the tibial nerve was 74.3 cm and that of the sural nerve was 38.4 cm (19), both of which were measured after origination from the sciatic nerve making these nerves over a meter in length in most humans. The long length of these nerves presents a challenge for maintaining the integrity of the axonal proteome because axonal transport rates from the soma do not readily account for rapid changes in protein content that can occur in axons, and these axonal transport rates are also inconsistent with maintenance of basic functions in very long axons, such as those that innervate the extremities in humans (18, 20-22). To overcome this problem peripheral axons transport mRNAs that can be translated locally to rapidly respond to external signals, and to maintain the functional integrity of axons (23). The majority of studies examining RNA transport into DRG axons have been done using rodent DRG neurons in primary cultures (24-27), although there is also strong support from in vivo studies for RNA transport and local translation of mRNA in DRG axons in rodents (22, 28-34). No studies have been done to assess axonal mRNAs in human peripheral axons, although we have recently demonstrated accumulation of the RNA binding protein FMRP in the central terminals of human DRG neurons (35). The secondary goal of our study was to ascertain which human peripheral nerve mRNAs originate from sensory axons using a combination of new and existing transcriptomic resources, followed by confirmation by RNA in situ hybridization.</text>

Our findings give insight into advanced DPN pathogenesis, providing evidence for major reorganization of the Schwann cells, and fibroblasts, and alteration of endothelial and immune cell signature with disease progression.

<text><loc_59><loc_169><loc_442><loc_431>The study design, representative DPN sural nerve morphological photomicrographs, and the study population and sample characteristics are shown ( Figure 1; Suppl. File S1 ). We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the tibial and sural nerves using bulk and spatial RNAsequencing and observed that the top expressed genes were similar in these nerves ( Figure 2A, B ). Among the top expressed genes, there are ferritin light chain ( FTL ), involved in iron accumulation and apolipoprotein ( APOD ), a glia-derived apolipoprotein that has been implicated in maintaining peripheral nerve function (39). Because we had paired tibial and sural samples from the same patients (N=5), we sought to examine distinct patterns in gene expression between the sural and tibial nerves. We identified a total of 321 differential expressed genes between sural and tibial nerves ( Figure 2C; Suppl. File S3 ). We observed that genes such as FOSB, CXCL2, EGR1, PTGES and PRPH were upregulated in sural nerves while GABRA3, HEPACAM, CX3CR1, NEFM and PTGIR were upregulated in tibial nerves ( Figure 2D ). We performed gene enrichment analysis to uncover pathways associated with these differentially expressed genes and noted that genes upregulated in sural nerve are involved primarily in nonneuronal pathways including blood vessel and vasculature development and neutrophil migration ( Figure 2E; Suppl. File S4) . In contrast, genes upregulated in tibial nerve were involved in axonogenesis, axon development and glial cell migration ( Figure 2F; Suppl. File</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_84><loc_442><loc_394>Next, we leveraged visium spatial transcriptomics, which maintains spatial context, to characterize DPN sural nerves with different degrees of axonal loss ( Figure 3, Suppl. Figure 1 ). Visium spatial transcriptomics uses 55 µm barcoded spots printed on specialized slides. The diameter of axons in human sural nerves ranges from 9 - 12 µm in adults (40), Schwann cells have a length ranging from 220 µm to 400 µm (with their thickness ranging between 2 and 5 µm) (41) and immune cells such as macrophages can be on average 21 µm (42) and T cells vary between 8-10 µm in diameter (43). Therefore, we first wanted to characterize the enriched cell types in a given barcoded spot. We used a sample with normal axonal density as a reference to identify the major cell types present in human sural nerves. We identified 5 major cell types in human sural nerve ( Figure 3A-C ): fibroblasts ( FBLN1, TNXB ), endothelial cells ( AQP1 ), Schwann cells ( SOX10, MPZ ), immune cells ( PLCG2, CD74 ) and adipocytes ( PLIN1 ). One of the identified enriched cell types expressed SRY-Box Transcription Factor 10 ( SOX10 ). We hypothesized that SOX10 may be a marker for a subtype of Schwann cells. Using RNAscope and IHC (two different antibodies), we found that SOX10 mRNA transcripts were highly colocalized with SOX10 protein ( Suppl. Figure 2). Additionally, SOX10 mRNA puncta were particularly localized in Schwann cells surrounding nerve fibers that colocalized with DAPI, which stains cell nuclei. Schwann cells, the glial cells in peripheral nerves, are key to maintaining axonal homeostasis, encasing them in myelin, supporting them through release of neurotrophins such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) (44), providing rationale to further evaluate how this cell type changed in nerves from DPN patients with moderate and severe axonal loss.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_409><loc_437><loc_447>We applied the same approach to samples with moderate and severe axonal loss and observed changes in cell types associated with axonal loss severity ( Figure 3D ).

The copyright holder for this preprint increase in endothelial cells, fibroblasts and immune cells in the sural nerve with severe axonal loss ( Figure 3D) . At the gene expression level, we observed that Schwann cells and myelinassociated genes were markedly decreased, particularly in the sample with severe axonal loss ( Figure 3E ).  We then conducted cell-cell interaction analysis using the Cellchat package (45) with focus on sural nerves with moderate and severe axonal loss and observed multiple cell-tocell interactions occurring in advanced DPN ( Figure 4 ). Our analysis showed that Schwann cells, fibroblasts and immune cells had the highest number of interactions in advanced DPN ( Figure 4-A,C ). With severe axonal loss, we saw an increase in interactions with adipocytes, suggesting that these cells are associated with DPN progression. Collagen was the top signaling pathway for both moderate and severe axonal loss samples ( Figure 4-E,F ). Collagens are important components of the extracellular matrix and of the connective layers in the peripheral nerve and our results suggest that changes occurring in these pathways may be involved in the nerve degeneration following DPN. The ligand-receptor pairs involved in these pathways are listed in suppl. Figure 3. We also analyzed possible interactions between ligands expressed by these enriched cell groups and receptors that are present in human DRG neurons (Suppl. Figure 4) . We identified several interactions that are driven by ligands such as Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ( APP ) which is involved in fiber organization and neuron remodeling. This suggests that the ligands expressed in sural nerves are likely involved in axonal degeneration and regeneration.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_356><loc_442><loc_442>Next, we sought to confirm our findings using an independent approach choosing cell type deconvolution to examine cell proportions within barcodes. We utilized a reference-free cell type deconvolution method, STdeconvolve (46), and characterized moderate and severe axonal loss DPN sural nerves (the visium frame for these samples contained both transverse and longitudinal sections). We observed similar results to our enriched cell type analysis and demonstrated that cell types drastically change with axonal loss severity ( Suppl. Figure 5 ).</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_47><loc_434><loc_117>Using cell type deconvolution, we identified gene expression markers for axons, myelinating Schwann cells, smooth muscle cells, perineurium and other connective layers in both nerves with moderate and severe axonal loss. Non-myelinating Schwann cells were present only with moderate axonal loss. Additionally, mitochondrial gene expression was observed in DPN with several axonal loss, implying activation of oxidative stress pathways with advanced disease.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_132><loc_443><loc_394>Guided by considerable changes in peripheral cell types associated with changes in axonal density, we compared the transcriptome of DPN sural nerves with moderate and severe axonal loss using bulk RNA-sequencing data ( Figure 5; Suppl. File S6) . Nerves with moderate axonal loss were significantly enriched in genes such as Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 7 ( BIRC7 ) which is a family member of inhibitors of apoptosis (47), ALK receptor tyrosine kinase ( ALK ) and myelin associated glycoprotein ( MAG ). Nerves with severe axonal loss showed an increase in genes such as peripherin ( PRPH ), calveolin-1 ( CAV1 ) and Collagen Type XXV Alpha 1 Chain ( COL25A1) ( Figure 5A,B ). Using imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (Xenium by 10x Genomics) and their pre-designed brain panel, we verified that ALK is expressed mostly in immune cells, MAG is expressed in Schwann cells. COL25A1 and CAV1 are expressed in fibroblasts; CAV1 is also expressed in endothelial cells ( Suppl. Figures 6) . These data suggest that multiple peripheral cell types (immune cells, fibroblasts, Schwann cells and endothelial cells) are altered and involved in the pathogenesis of advanced DPN with moderate and several axonal loss. Our gene enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed genes increased in severe axonal loss were involved in metabolic process, wound healing and signaling pathways such as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) receptor pathways ( Figure 5C; Suppl. File S7 ).</text>

The copyright holder for this preprint research; however, previous rodent studies have shown that local translation is crucial for the maintenance of axonal homeostasis and regeneration (26, 48, 49). As axonal degeneration is commonly observed in peripheral neuropathies, including DPN, we examined the expression of neuronal markers in human peripheral nerves. Using bulk RNA-sequencing experiments, we detected neuronal markers such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( TRPV1) and sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 9 ( SCN9A) in human tibial and sural nerves ( Figure 6A ). We also conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of previously published studies ( Suppl. Figure 7A ) and identified a distinct set of genes that appear to be exclusively in sensory axons, representing putative axonal mRNAs ( Suppl. Figure 7B ). To strengthen our hypothesis that these genes are axonal and originate from the soma, we show their expression in human DRG neurons ( Suppl. Figure 7C) . Next, we performed RNAscope in situ hybridization on human sural and sciatic nerves for the following neuronal markers: SCN9A , TRPV1 , PRPH , neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 ( NTRK1 ) and sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 10 ( SCN10A ) followed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to label cell nuclei (DAPI) and axons (peripherin) to provide direct evidence for RNA localization for these genes in human peripheral nerve axons.</text>

Overlap of SCN9A puncta with peripherin was present even in areas where there was no DAPI staining, suggesting that these mRNAs exist in both the nuclei of axon-supporting cells, as well as in the nerve axons. While we did not quantify RNA expression levels, the number of SCN9A puncta was comparable between sural and sciatic nerves. Colocalization with peripherin, in areas without DAPI staining, was also seen in sural and sciatic nerve for mRNA puncta of TRPV1 ( Figure 6C and Suppl.

<text><loc_59><loc_84><loc_438><loc_378>While SCN10A (which encodes Nav1.8) was not detected with tibial and sural nerve bulkRNA sequencing, Nav1.8 has an important role in nociception, so we decided to further investigate SCN10A axonal expression with a more sensitive technique, guided by previous reports of this mRNA localizing to rat sensory axons originating from DRG (28, 50). We observed only a few mRNA puncta colocalized with peripherin; however, this observation suggests transport for this mRNA in human peripheral nerve axons as well ( Suppl. Figure 9 ). The difference in sensitivity between bulk-RNA sequencing and RNAscope may contribute to the detection of a few SCN10A transcripts with the latter approach. In line with our bulk RNAsequencing data, our qualitative assessment of mRNA puncta suggests that SCN9A is more highly expressed in sural and sciatic nerves than the other mRNAs. Additionally, using highresolution imaging-based Xenium approach, we were able to detect neuronal markers such as parvalbumin ( PVALB ), tachykinin precursor 1 ( TAC1 ), and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 5 ( TRPC5 ) in peripherin-labelled human peripheral axons in longitudinal and transverse sections ( Suppl. Figure 10 ). We also examined markers of neuronal subtypes previously identified in the human DRG (51) and we identified mRNA expression for 96 out of 126 unique gene markers (76.19%) in the human tibial and sural nerve bulk RNA-seq data ( Suppl. Figure 11) . Identification of specific neuronal subpopulation markers can provide important information for the identification of specific subtypes potentially affected in DPN.</text>

File S8 ). RBPs such as Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is encoded by the FMR1 gene, is known to play an important role in RNA transport (59, 60). We found that FMRP was robustly detected in the DRG and sciatic nerve samples from organ donors, including those with a pain history ( Figure 7B) . Using IHC, we validated that FMRP protein was present within human sural nerves showing that the protein localizes to distal sensory axons ( Figure 7C).</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_209><loc_443><loc_440>Peripheral nerves are responsible for signal transduction to and from the central nervous system (CNS). In humans, sensory axons extend for a large distance and maintaining axonal integrity is crucial for normal function. Axonal damage such as that observed in DPN, typically affects sensory axons in a length-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of uncovering the pathogenic cellular and molecular alterations, including changes in axonal mRNA transport. Previous human and rodent studies implicated that inflammatory mediators released by different cell types play an important role in the development and progression of DPN (61). Additionally, studies on sural nerve biopsies found alterations in immune response, calcium signaling, and axon guidance (62-64). In this study, we characterized human tibial and sural nerves using a multi-omics approach. We found distinct pathways enriched in sural (sensory) and tibial (mixed sensory and motor) nerves following DPN. In sural nerves, we observed an enrichment in nonneuronal pathways including vasculature development and neutrophil migration. These findings support the notion that inflammatory processes and vascular alterations are pathologically important in DPN, affecting nerve function indirectly through microenvironment changes (65). In tibial nerves, the enriched pathways consisted of axonal biology-related terms. This suggests</text>

The copyright holder for this preprint that the mechanisms of injury and repair may vary significantly between different peripheral nerves in DPN. Patients with DPN often describe sensory symptoms such as pain, tingling or numbness but motor symptoms like weakness and loss of coordination are also reported, particularly in patients with distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy (66). Additionally, nerve conduction studies have demonstrated that alterations in the amplitude of motor nerve fibers generally occur after those observed in sensory nerve fibers (67). Unlike the sural nerve, which is a purely sensory nerve, the tibial nerve contains a mix of motor and sensory axons, so it is feasible that this difference contributes to transcript differences seen in our paired samples.</text>

Schwann cells are essential for the structure and function of peripheral nerves and contribute to DPN pathogenesis via oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation (70-72). Additionally, their impaired ability to produce neurotrophic factors crucial for nerve health, coupled with dyslipidemia associated with diabetes that alter the composition of myelin sheaths, leads to axonal degeneration and aberrant signal transmission (70). Using our spatial RNAsequencing data, we observed changes in Schwann cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells associated with axonal loss severity in DPN. First, using our cell enrichment analysis approach we observed a decrease in Schwann cells and their gene markers in DPN with severe axonal loss. Second, using our cell type deconvolution approach we found that nonmyelinating Schwann cells were the most affected, possibly as consequence of unmyelinated axon loss. Both myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells are affected by DPN. Myelinating Schwann cells are primarily responsible for forming the myelin sheath around axons, but in DPN, they often exhibit metabolic dysregulation due to the effects of hyperglycemia and disrupted insulin signaling, leading to myelin sheath abnormalities and nerve</text>

Non-myelinating Schwann cells, which enwrap multiple unmyelinated axons, are also crucial for the maintenance and integrity of peripheral nerves (74); however, in DPN, these cells are more susceptible to the toxic effects of hyperglycemia, impairing their ability to support unmyelinated nerve axons that are responsible for nociception (75). Previous research has shown that non-myelinating Schwann cells create wide signaling networks with immature Schwann cells and macrophages in an attempt to protect nerve function (76). Accordingly, our interactome analysis shows that Schwann cells establish interactions with immune cells. In DPN with severe axonal loss, we observed a substantial loss in Schwann cells and particularly non-myelinating Schwann cells that is also reflected in the reduced number of interactions. Instead, there is a relative increase in interactions involving immune cells and adipocytes.  Our interactome analysis also revealed that cell-cell signaling pathways occur between the enriched cell groups, particularly related to collagen and extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix and connective tissue layers of the peripheral nerves (epineurium, perineurium, endoneurium) play an important role in preserving nerve integrity and in the regenerative response to injury. A previous study showed that collagen V and VI were increased in DPN patient sural nerve biopsies and may contribute to the progression and limited regenerative response in DPN (77). This suggests that targeting these pathways early could offer an opportunity to revert to a pro-regenerative phenotype. We also observed that the top ligands expressed in the nerves can interact with receptors in DRG neurons. Interestingly, ligands such as APP and C3 are involved in axonal reorganization and remodeling, which suggests that peripheral nerve cells can release mediators that directly affect axons. Complement C3 has been associated with increased risk of neuropathy (78), suggesting that it may have a pro-inflammatory role that limits the nerve regeneration capacity. Similarly, APP has been associated with neuronal death in the CNS (79, 80) and may contribute to axonal degeneration in DPN.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_47><loc_443><loc_357>Due to shifts in peripheral nerve cell types identified between DPN sural nerves with moderate and severe axonal loss using our spatial approach, we set to investigate the molecular changes using bulk RNA-sequencing. Peripherin is an intermediate neurofilament and a structural component of axons. It has been identified as a marker of axonal damage (81) and functions in neurite stability and axonal transport (82). Peripherin antibodies were present in patients with type I diabetes, and a reduction in peripherin expression was observed to accompany hyperalgesia in a rat streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes model (82, 83). In our study, we observed an increase of peripherin mRNA in DPN sural nerves with severe axonal loss, suggesting that PRPH can also be a marker of axonal loss in human sural nerves. A previous study found that diabetic mice lacking neurofilaments experienced significant conduction velocity slowing and decreased nerve action potential amplitude, unlike those with normal neurofilaments who showed only mild neuropathy, irrespective of hyperglycemia levels (84). This indicates that neurofilaments aid axons resist diabetic damage. We also observed that caveolin-1 ( Cav1 ) is upregulated in DPN sural nerves with severe axonal loss. Previous studies in mice had shown that absence of Cav1 correlated with increased DPN severity, including motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, and mechanical or thermal sensitivity (85) and that low levels of Cav1 contribute to demyelination (86). Cav1 has also been associated with pain development (87) as well as anti-inflammation and neuroprotection (88). These observations suggest that there are regenerative pathways present in peripheral nerves that can be targeted to facilitate recovery in DPN.</text>

The copyright holder for this preprint important for development, regeneration and response to injury or endogenous molecule signaling (89). During pathfinding in normal development, axons respond to neurotropic cues through local protein synthesis (90). After tissue damage, translation can be initiated in DRG neurons and their axons, resulting in sensory neuron sensitization (91). Local mRNA translation can be advantageous by allowing for faster responses to stimuli than axoplasmic transport of proteins, which can take hours or days to traffic proteins to peripheral axon segments (92). Following axonal translation, locally synthesized mRNAs can also be retrogradely transported to neuronal soma and alter nuclear transcription, raising another mechanism through which peripheral protein synthesis can mediate nociceptive response (30, 60, 93). While rodent sensory axon transport and local protein synthesis had been shown for some mRNAs relevant to nociception, including Nav1.8 (34, 91), there is still much work to be done characterizing which mRNAs are translated downstream of nociceptive input, particularly in human peripheral nerves. In this study, we have identified for the first time mRNAs that are localized to the human sensory axons. Revealing which RNAs are transported into axons, and therefore can potentially be translated locally, could result in novel therapeutic targets for pain and axonal regeneration in DPN and other peripheral neuropathies.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_308><loc_442><loc_442>Directing mRNAs to specific subcellular sites requires three major components: 1) cis-acting elements within the mRNA, most frequently found in the 3′ UnTranslated Region (UTR); 2) RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that can recognize and bind to the cis-acting elements in a sequence-specific manner; and 3) the resulting ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that can, then, be linked directly to motor proteins or hitchhike to vesicles such as lysosomes and mitochondria for transport to a specific subcellular region (94). Our analysis revealed that several RBPs are present in peripheral nerves, including fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is a regulatory RBP that controls mRNA transport and local translation with known roles in neurodevelopment and synapse function (59, 60). Previous studies have shown that disruption</text>

The copyright holder for this preprint of RBPs involved in mRNA axonal transport can consequently lead to the loss of axonal integrity (95). This can result in neuronal degeneration and cause neurological diseases such as fragile X syndrome (FXS) (96), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (97), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (98) and peripheral neuropathy (99). Additionally, peripheral neuropathy is a common and significant feature of Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), involving damage to the peripheral nerve (100-102). FXTAS is a neurodegenerative disorder in individuals with the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation that leads to cognitive impairment, tremors and neuropathy. Males carrying the FMR1 premutation showed a loss of distal reflexes and a reduction in vibratory perception, and a strong correlation was identified between CGG repeat length and total neuropathy score in both males and females (102). The X-inactivation ratio, which determines the relative expression of normal versus premutation alleles, is thought to influence the prevalence and severity of symptoms in females (103). In line with these studies, our proteomics data show for the first time the potential involvement of FMRP in DPN, showing an increase in this RBP in human DRG and peripheral nerves with a history of chronic neuropathic pain.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_287><loc_440><loc_437>Overall, our study provides new, fundamental insight into human peripheral nerves and DPN. With increase in axonal loss, we observe a competitive interplay between regenerative and degenerative processes in DPN. On the one hand, there is an increase in immune cells and extracellular matrix as well as pro-inflammatory mediators that contribute to an inflammatory and degenerative phenotype. On the other hand, we detect mediators that can be targeted to activate regenerative pathways. Early targeting of genes and pathways involved in regenerative processes can open therapeutic avenues that directly treat DPN in peripheral nerves. Future studies using larger sample sizes and evaluating the functional effects of specific cells and mediators will be key to achieving this purpose. In addition, we identified the presence of specific mRNAs in the axons of human peripheral nerves, supporting our hypothesis that RNA</text>

All protocols were reviewed and approved by the UT Dallas (UTD) and UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSWMC) Institutional Review Boards. Patients undergoing lower leg amputation at two major tertiary care hospitals (Clements University Hospital (CUH) at UTSWMC and Parkland Memorial Hospital (PMH)) in Dallas, Texas were recruited as part of the study. Informed consent for participation was obtained for each patient during study enrolment. Tibial and sural nerves were recovered from diabetic patients who have non-reconstructable soft tissue or bone loss, recalcitrant bone infection (osteomyelitis) and/or critical limb ischemia and had been advised to undergo lower extremity amputation. The tibial and sural nerves were harvested from the part of the leg which was amputated (distal specimen). The specimens were placed in sterile specimen cups, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a - 80C freezer. Control sural nerves were recovered from nondiabetic patients having lower leg amputation due to trauma or non-reconstructable deformity. Details can be found in Suppl. File S1 . Additional controls (peripheral nerves) were recovered from organ donors at Southwest Transplant Association within 4 hours of cross-clamp, frozen immediately on crushed dry ice, and stored in a -80°C freezer as previously described (104) ( Suppl.

For each gene tested, we report baseMean (mean of normalized counts), LFC, lfcSE (standard error of the LFC estimate), P value (Wald test P value), and Padj (BH-adjusted P values).</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_254><loc_442><loc_404>We used Python (v3.8 with Anaconda distribution), R (v4.3.1), and Seurat (v4.3.0) (109) for data analysis. We used Seurat's spatially-resolved RNA-seq data analysis workflow  and used H5 files (output of the 10x spaceranger pipeline) as input for the spatial analysis. This analysis follows Seurat's standard graph-based clustering with the addition of tools for the integration and visualization of spatial and molecular information. The workflow consists of data normalization (using sctransform(110)), dimensional reduction and clustering, and identification of spatially-variable features that we used to label the clusters. The proportion of enriched cell groups was computed used the package DittoSeq (111). For spot deconvolution, we used STdeconvolve (46), a reference-free deconvolution tool. Cell types were identified based the top markers in each topic.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_68><loc_443><loc_170><loc_59><loc_180><loc_441><loc_298>We used the standard Cellchat (45) workflow to identify cell-cell interactions between cell types enriched in moderate and severe axonal loss samples. Separate CellChat objects for each sample were generated according to the instructions in the CellChat manual, using the createCellChat() function. This involved incorporating the normalized, scaled RNA data assay and the annotation labels from each corresponding Seurat object. Following the CellChat methodology, key steps included identifying the genes and interactions that were overexpressed in each cell group using identifyOverExpressedGenes() and identifyOverExpressedInteractions(). The computation of communication probability was carried out using computeCommunProb(), adhering to default settings. This function employs the trimean method, under the assumption that the mean expression level of a gene is considered zero if expressed in less than 25% of cells, thus resulting in a reduced number of interactions but enhancing statistical reliability. The communication network underwent refinement via filterCommunication(), which by default excludes cell groups comprising fewer than 10 cells. computeCommunProbPathway().

<text><loc_59><loc_47><loc_442><loc_97>Figure 6. Gene expression in human peripheral nerves. A) We performed bulk RNA-seq of human tibial and sural nerves and detected the presence of several mRNAs involved in sensory processing such as TRPV1 and SCN9A . mRNA puncta of SCN9A (B) , TRPV1 (C) , NTRK1 (D) , PRPH (E) in red are colocalized with peripherin (PRPH, green), which labels nerve fibers. Arrows point to areas where mRNA puncta do not overlap with DAPI (cyan), suggesting that it is axonal specific staining. Insets show zoomed-in images. Scale bars=10 µm.</text>
